We had the laughter clubs, the alcoholics anonymouses and now comes the <a href="http://www.drawingpower.org.uk/">Drawing Club</a>...well rather the 'Drawing Event'.  (via <a href="http://www.dannygregory.com/weblog/">EveryDay Matters</a>).

This will be one awesome event. I think the best part of drawing is the coloring :). Well I am not being mean to sketching, but I think color has more impact than normal sketches.. atleast bright, plesant colors are the best perk ups for tired eyes. 

Websites like <a href="http://ned.suckahs.org/">this one</a> are wonderfully relaxing after hours of staring at DOS terminals.
