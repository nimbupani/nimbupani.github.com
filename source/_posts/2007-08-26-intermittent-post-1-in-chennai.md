Probably going to be yet another huge void before I post again, but there were enough Indian milestones that got passed while I was in Chennai that merit mentions in this blog. 

1. India “celebrates” 60 years of Independence. Though ask not what is there to celebrate. There is something to celebrate though. The availability of BSNL's cellone signal on the mobile phone when I was on top of the hills of the Someshwara Forest (and why was I there you ask? read on). I was on my way to the airport when the taxi driver quipped on the huge line of cars ahead of us that were being checked in the name of security, “Sudandhiram Ellamal Sudhandradinam Kondadrom (without independence we are celebrating our independence day)”. 

2. Chennai celebrated 150 years of existence apparently. Newspapers, delighted by yet another opportunity of filling the gaps between advertisements, gladly reprinted copy written by good writers from a century ago. Also discovered that “Madras” was called “Chennai” in tamil print at least 40 years ago - which more than justifies the change.

3. I went on my first road trip and gladly I didn’t puke or fall sick. I actually <em>enjoyed</em> the 3 days. I have now seen more of Karnataka than I have seen of Tamil Nadu (my Native State). I went through reams of forests (Someshwara, Mookambika, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudremukh_National_Park">Kudremukh</a> and a bamboo forest famous for its elephants) , sea sides (<a href="http://www.holidaymakers.in/destination/beaches/murudeshwar.html">Murdeshwara</a>, <a href="http://www.karnatakatourism.com/coastal/maravante/index.htm">Marvante</a>), one backwater full of ergets, several weathers (foggy, sunny, cloudy, windy, rainy, cold, hot), one historic place (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belur">Belur</a>), several religious places, lots of villages (with sheep, goats, cows, hens). Special mention must be made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agumbe">Agumbe</a> which is the most beautiful place I have seen so far!

4. The control of Chennai’s cleanliness has passed on from <a href="http://www.chennaibest.com/discoverchennai/citylifestyle/feature10.asp">Onyx</a> - resulting in Chennai going back to its nasty smelly and disgusting looking ways. For the last 6 years I was happy to note Chennai’s rising cleanliness. But apparently the people who live in Chennai never did. 

5. Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onam">Onam</a>. So happy Onam everyone! 

So that’s that.
