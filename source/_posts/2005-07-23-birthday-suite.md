Last week I completed 22 years of my existence. I do not intend to put you through a reflection of my past but rather reflect the focus to my dear friends Ashwin and Deepak who planned the party =D And thanks a lot to all who attended. 

The unnerving part of course is that there were several bloggers than before! <a href="http://nimbupani.com">Me</a>, <a href="http://ashwink.net/blog/">Ashwin</a> and <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> being the original three =D <a href="http://antrix.net">Deepak Sarda</a> was there too. <a href="http://antrix.net">The</a> <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepaks</a> were introduced and were last seen disappearing into <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">ubuntu</a>. 

Othes were not so fortunate and feasted on the lovely cake (sorry couldnt get a good pic =() and listened to the music streamed from the ipod to awesome creative speakers (Thanks Ash!). It was decided that we spend the rest of the night playing some blighted card game.

Printed my designs on beautiful glossy papers! OOOh... love my design ;)

Meanwhile, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4708833.stm">London bombings continue</a>. People think life is a video game. If only it was.  Terrorists, you can achieve nothing by nuking the whole world away. There will still be hate and anger. It is human, just as it is human to classify and segregate hate. 

Fortunate to have Vrush over and click some pics of the house =D Here is a shot of my room =D
