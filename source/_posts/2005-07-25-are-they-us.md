I always had these mixed feelings about people who belong to the Indian subcontinent but not India: Are they us? 

Are we, as Indians, different from the Indian kids born and raised in U.S.? Or are we any different from the Singaporean Indians who were born and raised here? 

However hard I tried to make them distant and <i>not</i> us, it just kept rising up that they are us -atleast with regards to common heritage. And regardless of whether you possess a citizenship to prove your heritage, it is already in you. You dont need a plastic card to prove it.
