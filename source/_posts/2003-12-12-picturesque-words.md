<a href="http://www.khm.de/~timot/Sentences.html">This</a> is dumb charades with pictures! I am not sure who came up with this idea, but it sure is a good way to excercise your brains. I remember, in good old days, there used to be a regular feature in Reader's Digest called <b>Picturesque Speechless</b> or something like that which describes vividly (and very funnily) a scene or a picture (A reverse of the picture DC above). My spies tell me Reader's Digest in India will <a href="http://www.indiantelevision.com/headlines/y2k3/oct/oct14.htm">henceforth be published by</a> <a href="http://www.india-today.com/aboutus.phtml">India Today Group</a>. Not sure how different it will be. But I expect a lot more ads from Cosmo, India Today,  Music Today and Book Today and some self promotion ( just like Cosmo and India Today Magazine ).
