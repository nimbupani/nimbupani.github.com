I finally got my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1581809255/uc-20">The Word It Book</a> which is a <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/003240.html">compilation of illustrations done for the "Word-It" topic every week at "The Speak Up" site.</a> "Word It" is a section where people illustrate a word. For e.g. my illustration was for the word "star". And I am so happy they picked my illustration to put in the book!

Here is my illustration on page 169, with a short "interview" with me :)
