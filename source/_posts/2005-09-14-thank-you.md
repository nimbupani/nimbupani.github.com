Thank you, every one of you, for every second you spend on my webpage. No, I am not dying nor is my blog, but I am acknowledging everyone of you for your act of reading my blog - by choice. 

Thank you dear readers, your every second of activity on my page made a difference to my life - online and offline. 

Those of you who leave comments, your comments(whether negative or positive) make my day, the fact that you do take the effort to leave comments takes something! 

Thank you Bloglines subscribers, for reading what I publish and even putting up with the crap RSS Feeds I had (before). I apologise for that now. 

And thanks to all Internet Explorer users who still visit this place despite it looking despicable in IE! 

<strong>Thank  you all!</strong>
