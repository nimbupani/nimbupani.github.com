This one completes the Indian manufacturing Industry's boom time. BBC <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/3313229.stm">reports</a> the forays of an Indian distillery into Scotland -the land of the Scotch Whisky.

I don't like whisky. But it is interesting to read about the reactions of the connoisseurs.  Even more interesting is the fact that the drink is manufactured in Bangalore! 

I wonder what it is about Bangalore that it is attracting the attention of not just the IT industry but also the manufacturing gangs?

<b>P.S.</b> I remembered the ancient Indian heady drink which was very generally called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma">Soma</a>.
