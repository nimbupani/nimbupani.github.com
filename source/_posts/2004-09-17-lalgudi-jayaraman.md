I realised I have hardly written or heard classical music. I guess its the lack of resources and lack of active interest on my part. But one person whose classical music I will always listen to is <a href="http://www.chennaionline.com/musicseason99/profile/lalgudijayaraman.html">Lalgudi Jayaraman</a>. When he plays the violin it seems like he is invoking and play-acting the emotions that the song conveys. In his hands, each syllable is caressed and exhorted to reveal its true colours and every strain of music is bursting with the nature of the song.  I really really LOVE his rendition of <a href="http://www.geocities.com/promiserani2/c1323.html">"Eppo Varuvaro"</a> .. pulls me into depths of sadness, making me feel as despondent as the composer of the song. 


P.S. It isnt a hen's footprint in my sketch on the right bottom, but my very own "signature".
