There seems to be too much <a href="http://www.kiruba.com/archives/2004_12_01_archive.html">about</a><a href="http://tragicomix.blogspot.com/2004/12/sex-and-indian-psyche-history-project.html"> sex</a> these days. The first post had comments which totally pissed me off. Face it guys, it is not a rule that women wear bras. Bras are constricting. It will help if you try to tie a cloth tightly to your chest in your waking hours.You will see why women share a love-hate relationship with the bra. Two, seeing a woman naked is not porn, porn is what you see when you open your favourite crack site in Internet Explorer. 

The second post, which is a very desperate attempt by my dear batch mate to gain notoriety... er...attention is interesting coz, even though he has a point, I would fling it aside as an attention grabbing article without substance. Here is why:
<ul><li>It is not just in India where sex is a taboo. It is a taboo everywhere: That is why they dont show sex "as it is" in any "general" show. That is why "fuck" is a word that you will never see in any "general" show/movie- which is why we have movie ratings and moves with steamy scenes never make it to a "PG" also. </li>
<li>Free sex is not an idea that is tolerated in any society (Except perhaps the Osho's commune?).</li></ul>
