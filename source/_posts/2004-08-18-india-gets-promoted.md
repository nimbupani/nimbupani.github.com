Despite several arduous battles to keep the Olympic medals far away from the Indians by the very patriotic Suresh Kalmadi, we have an Army Major <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3573990.stm">winning the Silver</a> in the Olymics shooting event. Wow!!! This is the best advertisement Indian Army can ever have! Not even U.S. army has achieved this distinction I think.
