<a href="http://www.jivha.com/blog/archives/000406.html">This</a> article got me thinking. Indian advertisers have recently <a href="http://www.ndtv.com/business/showbusinessstory.asp?slug=Indian+advertising+goes+global&id=14939">started winning a lot of awards</a>.  And truly, they deserve all the accolades. 

The most wonderful ads I have seen are from <a href="http://www.agencyfaqs.com/tvc/sboard/raymond_pals_2211_2001.html">Raymond</a> and <a href="http://www.amulgreetings.com/">Amul</a>. Of course, Cadbury's and Bajaj also used to have good ads once in a while. But the most famous ad is the one for <b>Nirma Washing Powder</b>. The girl, who whirls around in a white frock, is the source of lots of myths and mysteries.  One voice  said the girl died young. Another cooed that the girl was the Company Owner's daughter. 

But whatever it may be, this is the most enduring ad and the most loved. As enduring as <a href="http://www.intelindia.com/mahabharat/synopsis_ramayan.htm">Ramayana</a> and <a href="http://www.intelindia.com/mahabharat/mbondvd.htm">Mahabharata</a>

P.S: I would be very grateful if you could pass the Nirma Ad to me. I couldnt find it on the internet. Nirma nostalgia beckons  :)
