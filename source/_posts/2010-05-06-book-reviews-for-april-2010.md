<p>I am surprised I managed to read five books after <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-mar-2010.html">last month&rsquo;s poor showing</a>. I should probably have a lot more to review next month, given all the downtime I have thanks to travel. Onward with the reviews!</p>

<h3>300</h3>

<p>After Sin City, I had great expectations of a Frank Miller adaptation, but unfortunately, 300, the film, was a disappointment. I was so sure that it was the fault of the movie makers and not the book itself, that I borrowed it just to feel smug in my point of view. Sadly, I was proven wrong. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1569714029?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1569714029">300</a> sucks.</p>


<h3>Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</h3>

<p>I did not know about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_American_Life">This American Life</a> before I moved to Seattle, so, it is not that embarrassing to admit I did not know about David Sedaris before I found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316010790?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0316010790">Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim</a>  in the &ldquo;Staff Picks&rdquo; of Seattle Library.</p>  

<p>Every story reminds me of the narratives from <a href="http://waiterrant.net/?m=200404">Waiter Rant</a> (if you have never read Waiter Rant, be prepared to spend the next 5 hours reading it). I loved &ldquo;The End of the Affair&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1fqvBhAnys">audio version</a>) the best (probably because it resonates so well).</p>


<h3>If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!</h3>

<p>I did the Landmark Forum sometime ago, and this book is like a word-for-word description of what goes on there or in any self-help seminars - except the author is actually a psychotherapist instead of a &ldquo;life coach&rdquo; and describes his work with sexual offenders.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553278320?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0553278320">If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!</a> is a great insight into what happens to a psychotherapist as he treats people for their mental illnesses (yes it affects him too). Unfortunately, this book is dated (Sheldon Kopp considers homosexuality, a &ldquo;mental illness&rdquo;), but a good read on how psychotherapists try to resolve issues for their patients.</p>

 
<h3>The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Volume 10</h3>
<p>Yet another random pick from the Graphic Novel bookshelf. Thankfully, it is awesome. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595824464?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1595824464">The Kurosagi Corpse Delivery Service Volume 10</a> has everything to do with corpses turning into clones, robots, zombies, and every other absurdity imaginable. Must read, if you like absurd manga.</p>

<h3>Infidel</h3>

<p>This book has caused the author, Ayaan Hirsi Ali to go into hiding. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743289692?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0743289692">Infidel</a> is not a simple put down of Islam but an examination of questions that grip a progressive follower of Islam. I did get a few goose-bumps when she described her genital mutilation, and how resigned Somalian women were to their fate. Her descriptions of assimilating into Dutch culture <a href="http://nimbupani.com/decade-in-review.html">mirrored my own experiences of doing so in Singapore</a>. </p>

<p>I am sure this book is biased (after all it is an autobiography), but no where does she condemn Islam for anything other than the practices followed by the hard-liners.</p>

<p>And so it ends! Any books you read last month that you recommend?</p>
