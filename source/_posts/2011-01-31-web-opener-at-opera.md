Good news everyone! I am now a Web Opener at <a href="http://opera.com">Opera</a>. 

I will be writing, breathing Open web standards while also making sure pesky websites that break in Opera no longer do so.  It is a milestone on a journey that started almost two years ago when I started taking web development seriously instead of just another means to an end ($$$). 

Needless to say, I will continue working on all the Open Source projects I am involved in (<a href="http://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, <a href="http://html5readiness.com">HTML5 Readiness</a>, <a href="http://w3fools.com">w3fools</a>, etc) and hopefully more!

I should also mention that, unless I specifically say so, my opinions are solely MINE and not of my employers, just in case you assume otherwise. If you have any questions about Opera, open web standards, do reach me or any of us @<a href="http://twitter.com/ODevRel/">ODevRel</a>!
