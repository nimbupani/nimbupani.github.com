A movie made for the only purpose of the upliftment of the morale of British citizens by showing  how 'hot' American girls lust after even the ugliest of British boys and how the Prime Minister of Britain (Hugh Grant in a curiously Tony Blair look) , for once, does not act like the pet puppy of the U.S. It is quite a coincidence that even in the film the U.S President visits GB just like it happened <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3279179.stm">sometime back</a>. 

The film has its moments. Its about love in all forms- brother love, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082314/">Ek-Duje-Ke-Liye</a>-but-happy-ending love, kiddo love, i-forgot-to-tell-you-i-love-you-before-you-got-married love, the yes-i-love-the-prime-minister love and i-once-loved-you love. Whew, and in the middle of all these affairs, we have Rowan Atkinson (for once, actually decently comical) as the perfect example of the English Gentleman and Bill Nighy (the villain in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0320691/">Underworld</a> ) as Uncle Billy, the ageing pop star who makes a colourful comeback. 

Well, its my money's worth of fairytale. Its Christmas time anyways and I think this is one movie worth watching ( I am sure its gonna be better than the horrendous <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319343/">ELF</a>! ).
