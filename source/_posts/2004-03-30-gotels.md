I meant "Geek Hotels". <a href="http://www.geektools.com/geektels/">Geektools</a> has a list of hotels that are geek friendly -all over the world.  So if you are hunting down a <a href="http://www.legendofyeti.com/stories/intro/index.html">yeti</a> in Nepal you can seek help from the rest of the world by staying at an "internet friendly" hotel. 

P.S: The list does not have any hotels listed for Nepal yet. If you have had an enocunter with a "gotel" in Nepal <a href="http://www.geektools.com/geektels/hoteladd.php">tell them</a>.
