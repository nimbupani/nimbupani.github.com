Recently, the Delhi Municipality's Health Department <a href="http://www.hindu.com/2003/10/16/stories/2003101610250400.htm">has announced it will hold its anti-fire cracker campaign in view of the wide spreading Dengue!</a>

How foolish or short-minded can they get? Apparently the more the air pollution the more mosquitoes will die. And I am sure they don't bother about measly things like dead human beings  Or perhaps you should carry fire crackers and burst them whenever you see a mosquito near you. Better still to do it inside the Delhi Municipality Health Department!
