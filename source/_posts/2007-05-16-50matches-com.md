A few days ago, one of the projects I worked on <a href="http://50matches.com">50matches.com</a> launched quietly. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/500908851/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/222/500908851_5fbd69d636.jpg" width="400" height="246" alt="50matches.com" /></a>

Today, I found, while getting my daily dose of caffeine, that <a href="http://readwriteweb.com">Read/Write web</a> had an article on <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/are_social_book.php">50matches</a>. Of course, the article also quotes:

<blockquote>50 Matches sports a clean, unadorned design-- like Google --</blockquote>

This quickly snowballed, and the next thing you know, its on <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us home page</a> and its <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular">popular links</a>. 

The simple design was precisely the intention of the 50matches team and me. Coz I think search engines should get out of the way of search results. 

The search results are more semantic now too. Sadly the HTML does not validate (but only 3 errors :) ). Thanks to the <a href="http://www.50matches.com/about.php">50matches team</a> for giving me this opportunity!
