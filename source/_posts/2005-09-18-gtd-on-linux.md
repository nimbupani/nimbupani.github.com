I have seen Deepak with this <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Gnome/Applications/Tomboy">Tintin software</a> (it has the logo of Tintin!), which I have fallen in love with. Sadly <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/space/Gnome/Applications/Tomboy">Tomboy</a> (thats the tintin software) ships only for linux =( 

Also, Deepak inspired me to start into "organizing my life" which had pretty much become murky muddy water with tonnes of work piling over other incomplete ones. Seeing how he actually got value from the book, i started on it.

Ahem, er, I dont do it as throughly as he does, (my list is just a huge pile!), but I guess you can! Head over to <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com/2005/09/gtd-with-linux-gnome-and-tomboy.html">his entry on GTD with Linux</a> for organizing your life and work!
