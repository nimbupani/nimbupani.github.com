A month ago, I surreptitiously threw away my old CRT monitor. Recently, as I was glued to the T.V., my glance fell on the year end episode of ClickOnline on BBC. I learned, as guilt kept on piling up at the back of my mind, how my old CRT monitor could have been <a href="http://www.bbcworld.com/content/clickonline_archive_23_2003.asp?pageid=666&co_pageid=2">useful to the underpreviledged in Africa</a>. Well, so if you are interested in donating your jurassic monitors to a good cause, just click on <a href="http://www.computer-aid.org/">computer-aid.org</a>.

I wonder why such organizations don't exist in India. Given that a basic computer is still beyond the means of the lower middle class, such efforts will go a long way in reducing the 'digital divide'. 

Other News:

 1. I don't seem to find any witty ads on the indian channels anymore. I hope it is just a passing phase!

2. For all you <a href="http://www.diamondcomic.com/subpage/chacha.html">Chacha Chaudhary</a> fans out there.. Sahara Channel seems to be airing a weekly episode called 'Chacha Chaudhary'. Having not read the real one, I am not sure how much of the 'real thing' is being preserved. But the old guy (Raghuveer Yadav of Lagaan fame) looks like Chacha Chaudhary :)
