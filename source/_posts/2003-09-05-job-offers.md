Today, I attended a 'Recruitment Talk' by one of the Big Four ( after Andersen's shameful fall) of the Consulting Industry, <a href="http://www.bcg.com">Boston Consuting Group</a>. Boy, all the castles I had dreamed of buying went away in a 'pff'. 

Okay, this is what that happened. This company wants its people to play hard and work hard. That's fine by me. It loves to have people who are addicted to challenges. That's not fine by me, but given the amount of money they pay, it's probably worth being a slave. It wants people with First Class Honours. Now, that's definitely NOT fine by me. I can't even dream of getting anywhere near First Class ( unless I score distinctions in every subject from now on). 

To top it all, they have atleast 6 to 7 gruelling rounds of interview and select just ONE person out of some thousand candidates to join their branch in Singapore. And what's more, their company has just 37 people working in Singapore! And just 2,600 people worldwide! (even Enron had more employees on this planet than BCG!) 

Well, the point is, they give no room for error. So, if you were on a binge the night before an exam, bad luck, you will never get to work at BCG ( unless you make up for that with some distinctions in your kitty).  Oh well, I guess that's why they are still one of the Big Four!
