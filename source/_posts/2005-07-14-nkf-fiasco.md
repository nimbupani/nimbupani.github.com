My website has taken a crazy lot of hits from <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=mrs%20goh%20chok%20tong%20nkf">google</a> and <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=mrs+goh+chok+tong+nkf&prssweb=Search&ei=UTF-8&fr=FP-tab-web-t&fl=0&x=wrt">yahoo</a> searches for "Mrs Goh Chok Tong" and "NKF". I admit I find this whole fiasco very interesting, as if I am present to a significant milestone in the history of Singapore. 

It is significant because for the first time in the history of Singapore, we have a newspaper unmasking corruption in a highly publicised charity organization htat has been patronised by most of the whos who of Singapore. NKF is more famous for organizing dramatic risky acts by top stars in Singapore to collect funds to "help" the Singaporeans who need dialysis or replacement of kidneys. 

And it is even more significant that for the first time the press has openly asserted its power in Singapore. 

Run over to <a href="http://tomorrow.sg">Tomorrow.sg</a> for updated blogs reporting on the incident. 

P.S. I am attending the <a href="http://tomorrow.sg/archives/2005/07/11/bloggerssg_2005_-_frequently_ask.html">Blogger Convention Discussion</a> Saturday at 2.00 p.m. Be there to share your views on blogging -even if you dont blog!
