<a href="http://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/cars/">Cars </a>is an awesome movie. 

It is in the same class as every other pixar movie. It is incredible how they deal with a variety of things (toys, monsters, bugs, fish, supermen, cars) and manage to come up on top with each of those, portraying emotions and actions which have never been seen before.  Cars is far beyond the animation that we saw in Incredibles. Each scene is life-like. Small town america has never been portrayed better! 

Meanwhile, the usual two minute film before the movie begins takes the cake this time. It is beautiful and brimming with innocence! 

Watch Cars, you will not regret your ride!
