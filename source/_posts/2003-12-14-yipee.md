Well, I guess I know what it feels like to win a lottery ticket. Thats how I felt when I saw a mail from <a href="http://www.edwardhugh.net/">Edward</a> today morning. After a harrowing battle with Java last night, the mail was refreshing, 

So, the result is that I will be posting entries in <a href="http://www.livinginindia.com">Living In India</a>. My first entry is <a href="http://www.livinginindia.com/archives/000033.html">already up</a>. I will be talking about Indian bloggers and Indian blogs in general. Boy, seems a lot for someone who started blogging six months ago! 

Ah, well its a start of a new journey! Hopefully I will write something useful (more than the crap that generally ends up here).
