Well, this blog is turning out to be a photo blog (phlog as I shall call it) now. But anyways, this is YAP (Yet-Another-Picture) from my handphone. The resolution doesnt look good.. but then I am sure you can give your neurons some mental stimulation by imagining how good it will look like if it was a snap from a digital camera :). But today was a lovely sunny day, after a long time. Feels so good to be out in the sun!
