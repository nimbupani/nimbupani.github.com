I am really, really doubting the claim of U.S. to be a "developed nation". Reading this <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/markosmoulitsas/story/0,15139,1331610,00.html?=rss">article</a> I am very confident of the equal standing (if not lower) of the U.S. politicians vis-a-vis their Indian counterparts! Where is democracy?
