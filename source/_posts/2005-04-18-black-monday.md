<a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/0,39020330,39195417,00.htm">Adobe's takeover of Macromedia</a> plunged me into raving depression of the bleak prospect of a long monopoly of Adobe in the image editors and graphic design software. 

I have always had a preference towards Macromedia for their cheap software, usable interface and simpler tools which were easy to master and create. Sigh....there goes an awesome software company! 

Macromedia REST IN PEACE!
