Oops, almost forgot to mention this awesome new site. <a href="http://www.publicgyan.com/">PublicGyan</a> is your source for what the masses think about what is happening in the world and what is going to happen in the world - and how that is reflected in the future events that actually happen. 

PublicGyan is like trading - you trade 'predictions' and buy or sell predictions at a price you want. If a prediction has a greater probability of becoming true, most likely it will sell at a higher price. Or, you can work like a sewer rat, sifting through the dumb ones to find a shining prediction that you think will come true!

Of course, the only aspect that is different from trading is, we close the predictions after they come true, or after they are no longer relevant - which only makes the game more exciting!

Go on, <a href="http://www.publicgyan.com/user.php?mode=register">register</a>!
