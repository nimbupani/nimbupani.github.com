This weekend was bliss. Saturday, I caught up with a friend from Uni and went painting at the nearby Garden. It was so amazing. Though we scooted at the first scent of the rain, I managed to get the outline of the building. Next weekend, will get my hands dirty with watercolors. 

Sunday, managed to not get out of the house the whole day except in the evening when I went to the opening of the new <a href="http://www.nlb.gov.sg">NLB</a> at Victoria Street. 

Wow, it is HUGE! But the directions inside were not as clear as other libraries, so me and my friend meandered towards the top floors and landed up at the Hype Gallery! And presto! My paintings are there too! =D They look kinda pathetic because they turned up very different on paper than on screen. Sigh...ought to learn to optimize illustrations for print!

Looked about the reference section (there are six levels of reference books mind you! And spent a good half an hour playing with the atlas there. Atlases are so beautiful! 

Finally got down to the business of looking up for books. Found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0425173747/102-9670253-7899337?v=glance">Curtain</a>, Poirot's last case (so called)! Yay! Finished reading it today morning. It is inexplicable and unbelievable. Agatha Christie's romantic notions got the better of her there! 

Bumped into <a href="http://preetamrai.com/weblog">Preetam</a>, who told me <a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">Rambling Librarian</a> was supposed to have a tour of the library on saturday. Damn! But it seems like he was there on Sunday too! If only I knew how he looked =D Rambling Librarian is the awesome dude who introduced us to the official <a href="http://alcme.oclc.org/bookmarks/servlet/OAIHandler?verb=GetRecord&metadataPrefix=oai_dc&identifier=oai:bookmarks.oclc.org:vistaweb.nlb.gov.sg">NLB Bookmarklet</a>. 

Reached my NLB Loan limit and ended the visit with a drink besides the NLB listening to the acapella troupe, who were sadly singing lullabys. 

And if I ever get to be a student again, you know where to find me =D 

On an unrelated note, <a href="http://kirubakaran.blogspot.com">Kirubakaran</a> has a <a href="http://kirubakaran.blogspot.com/2005/07/googling-ogling-taste-of-lemonade.html">whole post</a> that summarises my skills that he got to know from google. That is the power of the internet! =D
