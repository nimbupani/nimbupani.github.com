Two terror attacks in differeny continents. Same message: Violence Doesnt Work. 

I like Gandhi. He was the smartest activist around. He knew violence doesnt get results. All it gets are reasons. Violence never worked. We have two World Wars to prove that. 

That does not mean, you do nothing about terrorism. Attack the terrorists. Find them out. Bring them to justice. Dont attack the nations. Dont use terror attacks as reasons to justify killing people. 

Saving the world by killing millions of innocents? Is that ironical or what? 

All fanatics who are now ready to blame islam and their lack of "culture" or "development", please note that it takes two to tango. Instead of blaming them for their perceived lack of "development", look at what you have done because of blaming them, you simply push them deeper and deeper into the dark ages! 

Muslims were the first to bring Indian thought to the western world, and we should be grateful for that. And be proud of the pioneers of science, development and globalization. It hasnt reached anywhere near the peak it had before. But stop making it a voodoodoll for your irresponsibility. Each of us are responsible for the two terror attacks that occured, in the way we behave, the way we think and interact with others. 

Dont waste two minutes in silence for the dead, do something in the two minutes to prevent others from dying.
