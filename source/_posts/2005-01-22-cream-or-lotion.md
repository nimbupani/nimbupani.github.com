I have always wondered how the cosmetic industry quantifies something as a "cream" or a "lotion". For example, you have a "hand lotion" and a "hand cream". So after looking at both the substances, it seems obvious that a "lotion" is more liquid than the "cream" which looks more solid than liquid. 

But <a href="http://www.lorealparis.com/">L'oreal</a> have beaten that assumption to a pulp. I had just bought something I have always used, except it was in a new package. It had always been a "cream" in the sense I have described above, but as I confidently unscrewed the top, to my horror the "cream" was not a cream but a "liquid" which was happily making its way to the ground (I was holding it sideways  assuming it was a "cream"). 

I admit this wont stop me from buying their stuff anymore (its good!). But  can't they even show a bit of concern for the regular users? Why call it a "cream" if it aint a cream? Why package it in that bottle with a HUGE mouth if it was a liquid capable of falling all over the place?

I have been more concerned about usability these days, but this bit of pathetic naming and design just sucks!
