Ha! When a website has not been updated for over two weeks, then its surely exam time! :) oh well, another month and it will all be over. Yipeee! then I can launch my newly redesigned website, (in php mindyou can I be classified as a geek now?)

Surfing is so much fun, I can get to sites which show me awesome cars like<a href="http://www.ephemeranow.com/cars/cars037.htm"> this.</a>
And how about a blog called <a href="http://www.shrednow.com/botd/index.html">"blog of the day"?</a> The world is full of people with better ideas than me! :(
