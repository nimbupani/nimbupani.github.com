As <a href="http://indianwriting.blogspot.com/2006/01/rang-de-basanti-watch-out-spoilers.html">Uma</a> said, the first half of the movie rawks. It shows all signs of greatness in the first half and would have achieved it had it not veered towards unnecessary violence in the second half. The story of the three revolutionaries was touching and real. I was not at all moved by the Bhagat Singh duplicates that flooded the market a few years back and this movie is the only one that bowled me over. Somehow, it all seems so real and relevant. But, violence never attains what it sets out to achieve is a reality that the film does not cover even though it could have. 

Swades didnt strike a chord, not as much as Rang De Basanti, but it did show what could be done to transform the society we live in. And Rang De Basanti does that with a whimper - for two minutes after depicting violence for more than two hours. But it was enough to inspire me. The only complaint I have is against the glorification of violent acts. 

<strong>Parallel Thoughts:</strong>
What kind of history is being taught in Pakistan schools? More about Muslim League and less about Congress ( the reverse being the case in India!)?

Irony of it all: That the grandson of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Ali_Jinnah">Father of Pakistan</a> has to be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusli_Wadia">Indian Parsi</a>!

HAMAS confronts its electoral victory and the shock waves it sent across the world. Hopefully, we will see a reprise of the dismantling of the IRA. Perhaps the best solution to terrorism is to thrust power to the unsuspecting terrorists. Humanity will take care of the rest.  

What is being done about the MiG crashes anyways? Why blame the Defence Minister when the nation has seen more Defence Ministers than governments? What is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_air_force">Air Force</a> doing?
