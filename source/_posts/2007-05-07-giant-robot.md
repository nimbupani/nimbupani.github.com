<a href="http://timesofmylife.wordpress.com/2007/03/27/giant-robot/">Times of my life</a> has blogged about something I thought was lost after I grew up: Giant Robot. 

Even though, this series was apparently most popular in the 70s, it was aired in my dear old <a href="http://www.ddindia.gov.in/">DD</a> (India's only television channel till early 90s) in the late 80s - early 90s. 

I remember fragments of the series mostly because I remember being scared by the robot and how threatening it looked but also enthralled by fights with godzilla and other mean creatures in Japan. 

I never really bothered to find out about it and let it be a show that I once enjoyed till I saw the post on <a href="http://timesofmylife.wordpress.com">Times of My Life</a>. And I cant imagine, for the life of me, why I was afraid of the stupid looking robot (though there is some fun in watching the idiotic actions of the robot). Nevertheless, it still captures my attention - which is why I spent the last half an hour catching glimpses of it on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daNYQKb3QfQ&mode=related&search=">youtube</a>!
