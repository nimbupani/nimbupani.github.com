I didn't realise how powerful my <a href="http://www.sonyericsson.com/sg/spg.jsp?page=start">T610</a> is, until I took this picture.  It blasts away all the new Nokia models. Be not coloured by the misleading ads that Nokia keeps splashing all over the place. Nokia phones do not have good resolution. The less said of the Nokia in-built camera the better.  T610 supports the largest number of colours and Polyphonic sound with 32 tones to the boot! can anything beat that?
