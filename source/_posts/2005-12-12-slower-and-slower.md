My grey cells have been inactive for quite a while on what topics to blog about. The only entries that suggest themselves are movie reviews (coming up: "War of the Worlds" and "Aeon Flux"). 

The sooner I acknowledge this breakdown in blogging, the faster I can make a choice regarding this blog! This may partially be due to my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/2005/12/02/new_commitments.php">several commitments</a> (blogging, "incidentally", isnt listed as one of them!) or my sudden leap of faith as regards to feed reading. Finally, I have managed to get rid of the addiction to reading feeds, and it feels good!
