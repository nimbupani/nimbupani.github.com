The Register is <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/11/15/einstein_relativity/">reporting</a> that Einstein is not the only person who can claim to have invented the theory of relativity. Apparently, two others were involved. What is more disconcerting, is that it claims Einstein could have stolen the formulae from a fellow scientist! Every dog has its day, I should say!
