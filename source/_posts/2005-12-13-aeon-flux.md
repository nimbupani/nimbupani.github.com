Aeon Flux is not the run of the mill sci-fi movie (like I, Robot) but has several elements that parallels Matrix in its concept and execution even though it doesnt postulate new philosophies. 

Aeon Flux has the best portrayal of cloning I have ever seen on screen (after the horror show of island) and it postulates a theory that your experiences somehow get into your DNA and when you get cloned, your experiences remain with you as "bad dreams". Perhaps, this explains why people know what they were in their "past lives" (Except, sadly, this theory isnt true!). So, Aeon Flux compensates for such a theory with vivid imagination, that seems compellingly real. 

Conferences happen within your brain, skin treatment band aids are instantly available. The only thing that doesnt change are the guns. You STILL need guns to fire and fight (and I think the only reason that is necessary is because the directors assume the audience cannot relate to any other form of violent acts).  People exchange their feet for their hands, and vice versa. 

The movie is also quite feminist. The lead male actor is content to fiddle with his chemicals while the female lead tackles the men, bullets, and pointy grass!

Watch it if you havent oredi.
