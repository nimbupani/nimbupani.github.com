<a href="http://www.metropolismag.com/html/content_1103/obj/index.html">This</a> entry (via <a href="http://www.telepocalypse.net/">Telepocalypse</a>) made me think twice about using my handphone (yup, its called handphone in Singapore). Cell phones offer twice the amount of privacy than ever before. Whenever you see a bore, it is so easy to just fish out your cell phone and furiously punch away a message to President Bush. Or if you are a recluse,  with the phone as your faithful companion, walking out in the sunshine has never been easier. The glass jungle has become mobile.
