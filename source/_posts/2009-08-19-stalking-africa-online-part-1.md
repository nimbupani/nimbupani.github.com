<p>For the last two years, my secondary interest (apart from web design and illustrations) has been the African continent. I do not know where this interest came from. I suspect it must have been after reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No._1_Ladies'_Detective_Agency">No. 1 Ladies&rsquo;s Detective Agency series</a> by Alexander McCall Smith.</p>                                                                     
<p>I am well aware that I am pandering to a stereotype by referring to this vastly diverse set of people as &ldquo;Africans&rdquo;. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/067973869X?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=067973869X">Africa: A Biography of the Continent</a> opened my eyes to the start contrasts  in African regions. But, I hope this list below gets beyond such stereotypes.</p> 
<p>If you follow Fox news or the CNN you might think Africa is either a continent constantly at war or filled with naked poor people clicking their tongues (yes, I am exaggerating a bit — only a bit!). If you want to know better, you have to look elsewhere. Here are some of my sources of African news, music, culture that I have come to love.</p> 
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://chrisblattman.com/">Chris Blattman’s blog</a>
	Chris Blattman talks a lot about Africa, aid, development, and conflicts. Very informative and entertaining for someone from the academia!</li>
	<li><a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/">Foreign Policy Blog</a>                     
	Foreign Policy has the most thorough coverage of World News daily (even better than the BBC), as far as I know.</li>
	<li><a href="http://worldbeats1.blogspot.com/">Seattle World Music Blog</a>
	I discovered <a href="http://www.magic-system.fr/">Magic System</a> through them. Enough said.</li>
	<li><a href="http://esteyonage.blogspot.com/">The Esteyonage</a> talks about daily life in Liberia. I really like these <a href="http://esteyonage.blogspot.com/search/label/gettin'%20by">posts on how people get by</a> despite 85% unemployment in Liberia. The sidebar has great links to other blogs on Africa.</li>
	<li><a href="http://delicious.com/BibliOdyssey/africa">BibliOdyssey</a> blogs about old artwork/papers that are in the online archives of libraries/websites from all corners of the world. The blog does not cover African stories frequently, but every post on African art/manuscript blows my mind.</li>
	<li><a href="http://ugandaninsomniac.wordpress.com/">Ugandan Insomniac</a> blogs about Ugandan living, culture, and news. The <a href="http://ugandaninsomniac.wordpress.com/africa-reading-challenge/">African Reading Challenge</a> was a great source of reading recommendations for books on Africa.</li>
	<li><a href="http://wrongingrights.blogspot.com/">Wronging Rights</a> is a hilarious but tragic look at the abuses perpetrated around the world. Every post is worth its weight in gold!</li>
	<li><a href="http://africaunchained.blogspot.com/">Africa Unchained</a> is a formal look at news and projects occurring in Africa.</li>
	<li><a href="http://twiga.maneno.org/">Elia</a> writes about some little know films in or about Africa (among other things). A great read. There is an <a href="http://twitter.com/maneno">interesting twitter feed</a>, but I am not sure if it is the author&rsquo;s.</li>
	<li><a href="http://jackfruity.blogspot.com/">Jack Fruity</a> writes about technology, aid, and development. She also <a href="http://twitter.com/rebekahredux">tweets</a>. 
	</li>

	</li>
	<li><a href="http://congogirl.livejournal.com/">Congo Girl</a> writes about everything in Democratic Republic of Congo. I actually like <a href="http://twitter.com/congogirl">her twitter feed</a> more!</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.scarlettlion.com/">Scarlett</a> is a photojournalist based in Liberia. Excellent <a href="http://twitter.com/scarlettlion">tweets</a> and blog.</li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/rarin">Rarin</a> is an African software engineer in US. A perfect combination for my African information hunger!</li>
	<li><a href="http://twitter.com/nekessa">Julia O</a> is the publisher of <a href="http://kenyaimagine.com">Kenya Imagine</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/kenyaimagine">twitter</a>).</li>

</ul> 
<p>I have created an <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/files/africanblogs.xml">OPML file</a> if you are interested in bulk adding these blogs to your feed reader (it does not include twitter links).</p> 

<p>I will <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/stalking-africa-online-part-2.html">cover the podcasts I listen to and books I liked in the next post!
</a> Meanwhile, is there any other blog/twitter account you recommend following? Do post below!</p>
