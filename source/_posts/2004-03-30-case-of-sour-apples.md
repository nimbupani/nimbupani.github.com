This is the only way I could make my poor linux desktop pretend to be <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Miss Beautiful</a>.  A mac is too good- even in price. So all I can do is try and pretend I am working on a Mac I bought at the warehouse sale and feel good about it :)

P.S. The map you see is my Final Year Project, more later when I am done with it. The beautiful audio player you see is called the <a href="http://beepmp.sourceforge.net/">Beep Media Player</a>. It has lovely skins and is extremely customisable -which is what I liked the best. And the catch? It does not work on Windows (-evil grin-).
