<a href="http://tragicomix.blogspot.com">tragicomix</a> has started blogging (dunno if I should mention his/her name or not.. for fear of invasion of privacy). And so far it has been entries of poems. The <a href="http://tragicomix.blogspot.com/2004_04_01_tragicomix_archive.html#108318288415834196">one</a> about Singapore is quite interesting, even though a little exaggerated. I really like this verse:

<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.time.com/time/asia/asia/magazine/1999/990823/lee1.html">old man</a> he makes me work<br/>Disparate duties, I cannot shirk</p><p>He wrote our dreams, he made them come true<br/>And I laugh with the laugh track like I am supposed to</p></blockquote>

Nice stunt to get gmail tragicomix! :)
