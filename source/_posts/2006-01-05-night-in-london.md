Sorry for the long delay in my posts. I have no excuses :)

I recently bought the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158026/">Night in London</a> VCD, and London looks dramatically different from what we see today. But still, the need to have one firang to act dumb existed even during those days! 

Night in London has Mala Sinha in another Mystery Thriller. Her costumes are run of the mill. What is interesting is how vast and empty london looks. Also, the scarcity of Indian immigrant population also means, the film does not include them in the characters. 

But new movies, are not so isolated from the environment where they are shot at. There are firangi chracters doing a few roles that justify the location and give life to the chracters in the movie, unlike movies like "Night in London". Perhaps, being one of the earlier attempts to create larger than life pictures, we can forgive the movie directors for simply using the venues as backgrounds and not integrating them into the story line. 

Night in London, also shows the discrepancy in the fashion sensibilities of India and U.K. The costumes that the Indians wear are in sharp contrast to those worn by the British who appear in the background of the movie. Comparing that to current movie scenes, you can hardly see the difference in clothes!  I guess, that is what globalization does to you! In a way, the unique design sense of Indian fashion is becoming less and less unique! 

This movie is not worthy of your time, even if you wish to feast on retro London imagery.
