<a href="http://vyom.org">Deepak</a> has closed shop finally. It was very obviously coming. But well, I guess all in good time. All of us here are having a pretty depressing time now. No jobs, no opportunity in sight to get a job and no money (yeah thats putting it loosely- no thanks I am not dying of hunger as of now) is pushing our ability to look at the sunny side of things. 

All depressing thoughts are flooding through my mind. The time when I watched a cancer patient almost die. His shouts, tears and fear are still very real to me. His wife putting on a brave front when he was conscious - cheerful and pretending everything was alright - relapsing into tears as soon as he drifted into sleep. They were a young successful couple. A sudden attack of cancer had destroyed their fabric of existence. 

No, I do not have much experience with pain, which explains why I find even the situation of unemployment very depressing. I can attribute it to the sheltered existence I led till I left home for this island. 

Oh well, thats life. So I have come to realise. No matter how hard you persevere, it is the tide of time that takes you to unkown destinations. Not what you have done, or what you have the ability to do. Alright, enough of philosophical outpurings. All that matters is:
EVERYTHING WILL PASS AWAY<br/>
