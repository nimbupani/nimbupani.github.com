Roger Johansson has yet again written an excellent article on how <a href="http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200712/overdoing_accessibility/">accessibility techniques are misused</a>. And I just realised how pertinent that article is with regards to my note on <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/blog-entry/accessibility-in-singapore-websites.html">accessibility in singapore websites</a>. 

Of course, <a href="http://www.splintered.co.uk/documents/presentations/psf_accessibility_08.08.2007/PSF_too-much-accessibility-08.08.2007.pdf">the PDF by Patrick H. Lauke on Too Much Accessibility</a> is a must read for anyone who is interested in <em>not</em> abusing accessibility.
