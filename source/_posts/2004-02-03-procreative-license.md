The best part of my day is really surfing the net. Yeah, I am that non-geeky weirdo who likes to surf the net. Really. Look at what I found yesterday:
<ul><li><a href="http://www.rozworks.com/journal.html">Rosyln's awesome journals</a>-yeah someday I will be there too!</li>
<li><a href="http://www.dannygregory.com/weblog/">Danny Gregory's blog</a>-An expert on making journals</li>
<li><a href="http://www.lessig.org/images/warrior2.jpg">Lawrence Lessig's son</a>-This adorable creature is already following papa's steps, please note the 'Procreative Commons License on his shirt</li></ul>
