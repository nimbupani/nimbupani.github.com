In the five years I have lived in Singapore, the only elections I knew where the elections to the Student's Union of NTU. So, it was a shocking surprise when people were all worked up for the elections this year. Even more shocking was <a href="http://www.wcartc.org.sg/Meet_Mdm_Ho.html">Madam Ho</a> knocking up on my doors and wishing me!<br /><br />First, Madam Ho is very charming. Second, she has a large group of supporters/logistics people who do the groundwork of making people ready for her visit. Surprisingly, most of them spoke english haltingly (which, I think, is impossible for a Singaporean)! <br /><br />Most importantly, she climbed her way up to all the floors! If that aint hardwork I dont know what is! :) <br /><br />After a formal introduction, she asked me if I was a Singapore Citizen, and I told her I was a PR. With "Well, look at becoming a Singapore citizen soon!" she left. Perhaps, I would have heard more, if I was a citizen! <br /><br />But, really, I have no complaints, nor suggestions for improvement. My area is as best as it can be! So, I wonder, why these Meet the People sessions before the elections? Not like there are any Opposition MPs contesting this area either!<br /><br />More on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15th_Singapore_general_election">Singapore Elections</a>.<br /><i><br />Sidenote:</i><br />Also, I am curious to know the Singapore usage of "Madam" as a title which I havent seen elsewhere. Any idea why we use it?
