Yesterday, as I was walking to a shop to pick up a pre paid card for my mobile phone, a salesman (I am assuming that person was a salesman from the tie and the huge bag that are the adornments of an Indian Salesman) hit my nose with his hand as he was asking for a lift from a passing motocyclist. Imagine my surprise when, instead of apologising, he turns and says "it's alright"! The nerve!
