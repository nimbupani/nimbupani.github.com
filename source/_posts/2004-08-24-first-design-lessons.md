From my first attempt to design a website, I have learnt a few lessons which I need to make a note of, incase I forget it the next time I indulge in my fascination to be web designer:
<ul><li>Always run the worst case scenario template. I didnt realise there was a problem with the css for scoble's site till I saw his site on mozilla, with a long scrolling list of articles. Then a quick check at <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog">Mike Industries</a> revealed the problem.</li>
<li>Always check the template. The problem was also because of a dumb <i>div</i> in the template which was misplaced. So the next time I test anything, I better make sure the template is right too</li>
<li>Check typos everywhere, logo, template, sidebar, css. Never ever make a typo again!</li>
<li>Wish and wish for an Apple iBook/Powerbook. Sigh.. wish I could do something about this. </li></ul>
