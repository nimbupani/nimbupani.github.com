On the marked day, me and <a href="http://www.selectiveamnesia.org">ravages</a> (who very kindly gave me a lift to and from the venue, thanks a zillion chandru!) made it to the watering hole quite early. While we were waiting for others to turn up, a stern looking waiter left a note which stated there was a Rs.25 cover charge for sitting in that place without ordering! So, we ordered some stuff (me going for the  cheapest, which was coincidentally Rs. 25) when <a href="http://www.kiruba.com">Kribs</a> and <a href="http://benvsben.blogdrive.com/">Alex</a> trooped in. Kribs had this idea of putting tags so people will find it easy to identify themselves with the urls :). Me and ravages were entrusted with the responsibility of writing down the names. I had this wild idea of writing something nasty about each of them in the name tags and promptly turned over the idea to the ad man Ravages who did do a great job of it :) (you can see some of the tags in lazygeek's snaps). 

By five people started trooping in and a round chair conference started. <a href="http://www.mdeii.blogspot.com">Anand</a>, the film maker wannabe, was the funny bunny :) (no offence anand!), who regaled the people with funny repartees along with lazygeek. The matyrs of the event were <a href="http://www.kingsley2.com">Kingsley</a> and <a href="http://sudhon.blogspot.com">Sudhon</a>, who made it despite their respective illnesses.<a href="http://www.cyberbrahma.com/rants/"> S.K.</a>, the wise forever young man :) talked about his experiences as a webmaster for Indian Railways and those of you in India who wish to have unlimited internet access for free, please start looking at the Recruitment ads for Railways IT positions!

Soon, it was dusk and mosquitoes got the better of kribs and we took pity on the blog evangelist and started dispersing. This was a period for some more interaction where I met <a href="http://ravikumar.blogdrive.com">Ravikumar</a>, who had tremendous respect and admiration for Lee Kuan Yew and for Singapore in general. Dinesh has described me as a "girl who does not like PSBBians or IITans", but please! no! I just don't like the fact that everyone seems to find some sort of common brotherhood (or sisterhood for the feminists), under "IIT" or "PSBB" and i seem to have none :P. Lazygeek found a shorter nickname for me:"pani" :P

I also found out, my name is too common, and this is the second such occurence (of somebody's girlfriend having same name as mine). The first was(is) an interesting experience, with people trying to call her (including her boyfriend) would call me and then  give embarassing excuses :)

I then exited from the scene and enjoyed a scenic ride across madras thanks to ravages. On the whole, a very interesting experience. I know I sound like a reporter of some of those cheap neighbourhood newspapers, but then my blog report is finished. 

<a href="http://arsenalsri.rediffblogs.com/">Sri</a> has a list of bloggers who attended the meet</a> and the pics of course are at <a href="http://www.lazygeek.net">Lazygeek</a>.
