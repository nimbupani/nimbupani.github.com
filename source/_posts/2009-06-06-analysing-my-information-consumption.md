title: Analysing my Information Consumption

<p>I had <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbupani/status/1770711281">tweeted</a> about wanting to analyse my feed reading activity &mdash; mainly to track what different topics I followed over the years. Neither Google Reader trends nor NetNewsWire stats charted that kind of data. Luckily, the list of blogs I was subscribed to, in 2006 and in 2007, are still online (<a href="http://www.bloglines.com/public/nimbupani">list for 2006</a>, <a href="/files/google-reader-subscriptions.xml">list for 2007 [.xml file]</a>). </p>
<p>Here is what number crunching turns up:</p>
<ul>
	<li>My web design follow list hasn&rsquo;t changed over the last 3.5 years. It is, more or less, the same.</li>
	<li>In 2008, I discovered a topic outside my usual interests: Africa. This led to devouring <a href="http://www.bookjetty.com/people/nimbupani/books?tag=africa">books</a>, <a href="http://listen.grooveshark.com/#/playlist/Nimbu_s_putumayo/8573383">music</a>, news, twitter updates about various countries of Africa.</li>
	<li>In 2009, I stopped tracking freelance jobs altogether (though I rarely ever read those feeds after 2006) as I started working full-time at <a href="http://microgroove.com">Microgroove</a></li>
	<li>In 2006, I was giving equal attention to graphic design / illustrations / decor. This changed in 2007, when I started devoting most of my attention to illustrations. This interest waned somewhat in 2008/09 where my attention was taken up by Africa.</li>
	<li>In 06/07, I had a lot of interest in decor (which led to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/sets/72157600880395997/">this</a>). <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/the-big-move.html">Recently</a>, I have become more convinced of the benefits of leading a spartan life and lost interest in hoarding stuff (however nice!).</li>
	<li>
The number of feeds I read seems to be reducing steadily &mdash; though they keep fluctuating every month. The main cause of this reduction, I suspect, is the increased use of twitter. Since I follow some of these bloggers on twitter, I don't feel the need to subscribe to their blog.

</ul>
<p>Here are the graphs for comparison:</p>

<p>Enough about my activities! I am very curious to know how your information consumption trend is like?</p>
