If you see this error when you (as I have) been innocently downloading a 2 MB attachment from a client - fear not (or fear the worst) as this is the dumb little <a href="http://gmail.com">gmail</a> that is creating a havoc in our lives. Apparently, they have made a mistake in attempting to solve the problem of spammers and have disabled hundreds of accounts. This is what we get in trusting google (the home of the uber-nerds) to be smart enough to not do such mistakes. 

This is where you can get the lowdown: <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-ABCs/browse_thread/thread/71546e8e321a3414/99b02ac52e3d5547">Is Your Gmail Account Disabled?</a> 

Interestingly, there is no account of this mistake anywhere on their site. Wait till one of the reporters get to suffer from it :)
