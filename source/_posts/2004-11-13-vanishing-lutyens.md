William Dalrymple is <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1350138,00.html?gusrc=rss">reporting </a> on the plans by the Delhi government to raze the rest of the great heritage bunglows of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lutyens">Lutyens</a>. For those who don't know, Lutyens constructed the (almost) only planned city in India -Chandigarh and the dearest Rashtrapathi Bhavan. 

It is a worrying trend. I hope somebody realises the value fo the treasures the government is planning to raze. I fear the day when the government decides Taj Mahal has reached "the end of life" will not be far!
