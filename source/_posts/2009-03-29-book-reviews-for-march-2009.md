<p>This month was a slow one for books. I managed to read only 4 (and complete only 3) and most were digital versions read during lunch time. I managed to complete the Hitchhiker Series and had a ball of a time with them. In between, I gave a written driving test so now I have an <em>Instruction Permit</em> which lets me learn driving.</p> 
<ul>
	<li><h3>The Color of Magic</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061020710?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0061020710">This</a> is the first book of the Discworld series. I am more in love with Terry Prachett after reading this one. The idea of Cohen the Barbarian is so brilliant! The passage where Twoflower describes insurance is rib-ticklingly hilarious. I have only exclamation marks to describe this book. It is a riot and a must read for anyone fond of witty humor. I am definitely going to read it again (provided I finish rest of the series!).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>Restaurant at the end of the universe</h3>
		<p>It is the worst of the Hitchhiker series. I understand why I didn&rsquo;t like it when I read this the first time. Reading this book feels like watching Spiderman 3 - so boring and predictable. But it is something you have to get through to go to the brilliant finish! </p>
	</li>  
	<li>
		<h3>So Long and Thanks for all the Fish</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345479963?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345479963">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</a> is an outstanding finish to the Hitchhiker series. John Watson is especially well done character in this book (who calls himself Wonka the Sane). Love his parts. Sad to see Marvin die though. Now I am really interested in watching the movie again. There are more contemporary references to Dire Straits, computers which are rather true and hilarious.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>On the Road</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142437255?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0142437255">On the Road</a> is a book I have been trying to read for the past 4 months. It is a book that is a cult classic and I just can&rsquo;t get myself to read it fully. It was like reading a list of blog entries of a hitch hiker.  I must note it was a very radical book for the 50s. There are flashes of brilliance, but for someone who does not feel the way he does, I guess it did not appeal to me. It is one of those things that you either love or hate it when you read it the first time.</p> 
	</li>	
</ul><p>April is going to be a slow month too. I have about 4 books, but I think it will be unlikely that I will finish reading all of them given that my weekends are going to be occupied with learning how to drive! What have you guys read lately?</p>
