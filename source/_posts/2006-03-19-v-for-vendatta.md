<blockquote>There is no certainity, only opportunity</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V_for_Vendetta_%28film%29"><br />V for Vendatta</a> is a remarkable film. It is a film that is hero driven from start to finish.V for Vendetta, like the Matrix, has references to several elements of philosophy, literature, history, and mythology. V is admirably played by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0915989/bio">Hugo Weaving</a> who I first had a crush on when I saw him first as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> in the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086672/">Bodyline Series</a>. Of course, he being ultra thin doesnt help in getting heroic roles, and in this one he has proven that he can be a hero too. <br /><br />V for Vendetta has an excellent screenplay. Every word couldnt have been more relevant or more beautifully put. V for Vendetta spouts philosophy more explicitly than the Matrix. And that, the world needs somebody who is willing to give up his life for an idea. <br /><br />I loved the dialog in the beginning of the movie about the idea. I cant recall it now, but it was something about the V being the idea and physical attributes are not necessary to know V because he is the idea (I am sure it was much better put!).<br /><br />V for Vendetta doesnt fare very well in action as compared to the Matrix or other action movies. But, the classicism of V for Vendetta is unparalleled. I loved the scene where Evey wakes up in a room choking with books and the scene where Gordon shows her his copy of the 14th century Koran. <br /><br />V for Vendetta is also mysterious. How come Gordon (Evey's possible love interest) does and speaks exactly what V did when Evey first wakes up in the house of V? Does Evey become the next V? <br /><br />Iraq and conservative christianity is a strong undercurrent of V for Vendetta. <br /><br />Of course, <a href="http://www.shadowgalaxy.net/Vendetta/analysis.html">the comics version</a> is very different. The only thing that is common are the characters and the beginnings of V. Otherwise, they might as well have been separate entities. I saw the summary of the comics, but I prefer the movie, thank you. <br /><br />Watch it. It is worth watching just for the dialogues. <br /><br /><br />
