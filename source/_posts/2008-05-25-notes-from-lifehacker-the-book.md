<p>I read <a type="amzn" asin="0470050659">Lifehacker: 88 Tech Tricks to Turbocharge Your Day</a> which was surprisingly available in the <abbr title="National Library Board">NLB</abbr>. A lot of it is already covered in <a href="http://lifehacker.com/366859/the-best-of-lifehacker-in-upgrade-your-life">The Best of Lifehacker in Upgrade Your Life</a> (the set of sources for the second edition of the book). Here are a few things that were new and interesting:</p><ol><li><strong>Using Flickr to capture Business Card Details.</strong> Also tag them so that they are easy to search and make sure you keep them private.</li><li><strong>Store fitted bedsheets inside pillowcases.</strong> A great idea to save space while packing for moving (which I am doing currently!)</li><li><strong>Mirror entire websites using wget.</strong> The command is <code>wget -m http://&lt;website-address&gt;</code></li><li><strong>Using Google to look up synonyms.</strong>Use "~" next to the keyword you want to look up</li><li><strong>Useful Bookmarklets</strong> are <a href="http://lifehacker.com/software/feature/geek-to-live-ten-musthave-bookmarklets-129141.php">listed on Lifehacker</a></li></ol><p>I would definitely prefer a PDF edition as the book is worth keeping as a reference. But the Lifehacker post - The Best of Lifehacker (linked above) - already covers most of the book. </p>
