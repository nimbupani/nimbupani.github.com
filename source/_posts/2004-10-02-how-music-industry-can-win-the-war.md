I think the music industry still has a lot of time as we havent yet started the broadband revolution in several countries. And even with broadband, the speed is not fast enough for the customer (not as fast as buying a cd and instantly listening to it on your CD player). Perhaps the music industry should awaken now and be aggressive in its efforts to attract the crowd of downloaders. After reading the speech, I got inspired to ponder on the alternatives the Music Industry has. Here is a list of what I think the big players should be doing:

<ul><li>Have a kiosk that prints the CD covers and records a CD from a iPOD or any other storage device. Its still cool to display CDs. </li>
<li>Get new artists.</li>
<li>Get on the web and sell accessories like CD cases etc.</li>
<li>Tie up with cafes to play music on demand. Sell services. Tailor the music according to the taste of the individual customers. and play the songs available in the music companiy's list based on the list in the iPOD. Earn income from the songs that a user downloads from the cafe server to the iPOD. Similar service through radio stations. </li>
<li>Invest in technology.Get in touch with night clubs. Provide special high quality music customised to the particular night club and unique settings. Tie up with DJs. Popularise ur records through the DJs. </li></ul>
