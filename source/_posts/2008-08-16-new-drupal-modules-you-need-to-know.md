<h3>Keyword Autocomplete</h3>
<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/keyword_autocomplete</p>
<p>Keyword Autocomplete lets you add autocomplete functionality to your site's search forms based on previously searched strings. The module saves keyword strings entered in search forms and increments a counter for the strings on subsequent searches. It then populates an autocomplete on search forms from these saved keyword strings in order of the most searched keywords to the least.</p>
<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5.</p> 

<h3>Top Searches</h3>
<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/top_searches</p>
<p>Supplies a block with a list of the top search phrases on the site. Useful for generating inward traffic within the site to older blog posts that generally do not get featured on the front page.</p> 
<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5 (stable)</p>

<h3>Search Autocomplete</h3>
<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/search_autocomplete</p>
<p>This module allows you to add autocomplete functionality on search fields in Drupal. It offers a drop down box of a list of results as you start typing.</p>

<h3>Related Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/related_terms</p>
<p>Terms are related to each other if they appear on the same node. The more nodes they appear on together, the bigger they will be displayed in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5 (no stable release)</p>

<h3>Tip Joy</h3>
<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/tipjoy</p>
<p>Tipjoy is a service that allows bloggers to collect tips from happy readers. Bloggers can either add “tip this” buttons to each blog post or just put up a general “leave a tip” banner somewhere on their site. On its front page, Tipjoy.com keeps track of tips given and received throughout the world, showing off the most tipped content, and featuring new content worth checking out.</p>
<p><strong>For:</strong> Drupal 5 (stable) and Drupal 6 (beta 2)</p>
	
<h3>Archive By Terms</h3>
<p><strong>Link: </strong>http://drupal.org/project/archive_by_terms</p>
<p>This provides a block which lists all the terms of a vocabulary. Each term is then split up into years. So for example you have a vocabulary "General" and in this vocabulary you would have 3 Terms. This Module would now generate the following structure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Term 1
  <ul>
	<li>2008</li>
  	<li>2007</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>
	Term 2
  	<ul>
	<li>2007</li>
  	<li>2006</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For: </strong>Drupal 6 (Beta 2)</p>

<h3>Unreleased Modules</h3>
<h3>Sphinx</h3>

<p>This module integrates the Sphinx full-text search daemon with Drupal. Sphinx is a full-text search engine, distributed under GPL version 2. See more at http://sphinxsearch.com</p>
<p>The module provides a search form and result pages. </p>
<p>Plans for this module includes:</p>
