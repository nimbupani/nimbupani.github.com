Ah that was a great weekend! I was trying to cook up excuses for not going to office today, but none was creative enough for me to avoid work and I did end up in the office. But then if I had missed office, would I have got the wonderful present given by my friends there? No, I am not telling you what the gift is, but its wonderful enough to make you envious :).

In other good news:
<ul><li>I went for an arduous three hour cycling in <a href="http://habitatnews.nus.edu.sg/heritage/ubin/stories/">Pulau Ubin</a>(Pulau in malay means an island). The island has the right combination of mosquitoes and greenery. And the slopes! Never cycled down such steep slopes in my life! And to make it really adventurous, there are a few vans that keep going along the long winded and steep slopes. You never know what lies beyond the steep bend.</li>
<li> Deepak has restarted his <a href="http://www.chakravyuh.blogspot.com">blog</a>. Guess the free one is better than the old one :) Hope you keep going on!</li></ul>
