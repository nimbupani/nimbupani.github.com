I almost missed mentioning <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/87967025@N00/sets/942515/">Software Freedom Day</a> that was held at Orchard Road on September 10th. I think the mainstream media missed it too...sigh. 

Anyways, seems like the Software Freedom Day was a riot! We had a tux that was dawdling among kids, screechy delirious teenages, respectful grandmothers and grandfathers.

<a href="http://antrix.net">Deepak S</a> and <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak J</a> were volunteering by evangelising Ubuntu, the new mac OS of the Free Software World, and distributing free copies of the same. 

Next year, we better get some HOT cheerleaders to distribute and propogate the Free Software Movement ;-)
