Well inch by inch this weblog is getting ready for a launch.. by which time i have changed hte template like a billion times. This was the design which lingered the longest in my mind.. which is why it is styled so.. and please enable CSS on your browser, otherwise this weblog will suck big time. 

<b>Acknowledgements</b>

This site is mainly up due to the prodding of my good friend Deepak. His now defunct <a href="http://vyom.org">weblog</a> was an inspiration for many :)

Also to be acknowledged is <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org">Mark</a> from whom i have stolen the menu tabs. The fact that I havent yet lost my fancy for these tabs speaks volumes about how much I adore them!
