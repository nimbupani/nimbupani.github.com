Agreed this topic is a bit stale. But it becomes fresher when <a href="http://www.adactio.com/journal/display.php/20031208220021.xml">creative ideas</a> start rolling out on how to beat piracy. While discussing this topic with <a href="http://vyom.oef">Deepak</a>, I came to know about this service called <a href="http://freenet.sourceforge.net/">Freenet</a>. If used to distribute songs and movies, what wonders it would do to the world of internet piracy! I am not sure how <A href="http://www.riaa.com/issues/piracy/default.asp">RIAA</a> is ever going to succeed in this campaign to stop piracy. There will always be smarter people with faster access to internet and with smarter ways to get round the law. Freenet is just one of these ways. 

Now, I shall hope RIAA does not find this libelous enough to sue me! :)
