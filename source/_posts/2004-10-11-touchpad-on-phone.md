The only irritating feature of my phone is the stupid joystick. Of course its better than not having one at all, but it isnt serving its purpose as well as it should. 
Whats the purpose I want to use it for? 
<ul><li>Scrolling</li>
<li>Selecting text</li>
<li>Selecting menu items</li>
<li>playing games</li>
<li>navigation</li></ul>
My main complaint is againt the technology of SMS. It plainly sucks. I cant select a text and delete the selected text. I cant even copy a selection. What the hell, I cant <i>select text</i>. 

All my life my best friends on the screen were <i>copy</i> and <i>paste</i>. And the mobile phones take away that friendship and put me inside a big bad world of typing and retyping. I really cant imagine how people actually <i>post</i> from a mobile phone to their blogs. No I am not complaining about PDAs. I am talking about the normal jazzy phones that hit the market every christmas. 

I never liked surfing the net using my phone. Its so user-unfriendly. I take more than a minute to type the address I want to reach. I cant set a home page. The user interface cant intutively detect the website I want to reach (that PC Browsers do) and it takes more than two minutes for the website to download. Whats worse is the navigation. I need to keep clicking on the joystick to select the links <i>one by one</i>!! 

So, when mobile phones pretend to be smart phones, i cant understand how they can do so without even offering so much of a cursor to navigate! PDAs use "stylus" for navigation. But the severly constrained screensize on the mobile phone will definitely not suit a stylus. 

So here is my suggestion, why not a touchpad and a cursor? A touchpad that can be used to scroll and navigate much more faster than the jerky joysticks. A touchpad with left and right click options that will make my phone more like a laptop with its ease of use and navigation.

Touchpad does not require too much space. A small rectangular area below the mobile screen will be good enough! Perhaps we can have an autolocking feature on the touchpad to prevent accidental actions. 

What will a touchpad solve?
<ul><li><strong>Navigation:</strong> I can scroll down faster by just moving my finger on it faster and NOT hurting it. </li>
<li><strong>Selection:</strong> I can select the text if I have the left and right mouse keys just like the laptop and copy and paste wherever I want. </li>
<li><strong>Games:</strong> The games will be more userfriendly and more attractive. </li>
<li><strong>Selecting Menu:</strong> The user interface need not be constrained on the screen as it is now. </li></ul>

Update: Found <a href="http://www.geekzone.co.nz/content.asp?ContentId=3340">this</a> thro google. Not quite there yet. But a vast improvement over the present joysticks.
