<p>I came across this great list of usability rules in a presentation by Denise Stephen called "Enabled by Design meets Scripting Enabled" which was given as part of the <a href="http://scriptingenabled.org/presentations/">Scripting Enabled</a> event organized by <a href="http://www.wait-till-i.com/">Christian Heilmann</a>. Here goes the list:</p><h3>Usability - The golden rules</h3><br/><ul>
	<li>Simply presented information</li>
	<li>Content reduced to essentials</li>
	<li>Manageable logical structure</li>
	<li>Intuitive usability</li>
	<li>Uniform appearance, consistently designed</li>
	<li>Good design and appealing graphics</li>
	<li>Quick delivery of information</li>
</ul><p>There are some great slides at ScriptingEnabled which are up on Slideshare - like this one <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cheilmann/why-i-hate-the-interweb-kath-moonan-at-scripting-enabled-presentation">Why I hate the Interweb</a> (a presentation on the challenges that face different kinds of disabled users online).
