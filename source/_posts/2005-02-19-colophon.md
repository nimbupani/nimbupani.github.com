I started nimbupani in 2003 when two of my <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">closest</a> <a href="http://wendelin.blogspot.com">friends</a> started to blog. It was my first attempt at web design and writing. Previous incarnations were consequently slightly uncomforting to look at, but I am glad to say I have looked and learned a bit since then. 

<h2>The Name</h2>

Nimbupani means literally "Lemon water" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindi">hindi</a>.Nimbupani, is a favoured drink in India especially during the deliriously hot season (which seems to be replacing the rest of the seasons in India). Nimbupani is supposed to be pronounced <i>nimbupaani</i>. Nimbupani is cool, refreshing and revitalizes you for the long day ahead. I personally prefer <a href="/www.indiatastes.com/categories/227.html">buttermilk</a> though. But buttermilk isnt a cool name to give to a website, is it?

<h2>Design</h2>

I am guilty of all the artwork, design that you see on this site. I have hopefully compiled with the latest standards and if the site doesnt validate, just <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbupani">holler</a>. 

This website uses <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and CSS for ease of use. The links that you see on the right are a separate PHP page which in combination with CSS is used to hilight the current active page. 

<h3>Typography</h3>

If you are a Mac user, congrats! You can experience the power of Lucida Grande while Windows users can stick to the pathetic Franklin Gothic Medium. I cant help it if Windows sucks. 

<h3>Machines</h3>

Designed on a Mac Mini using trial versions of Dreamweaver and Fireworks MX. 

<h3>Content Management System</h3>

I use <a href="http://movabletype.org">MovableType 3.15</a> to power this website. The plugins I use on this site are:<ul><li><a href="http://www.zonageek.com/software/mt/validable/index.php">Validable</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Privacy</h3>

Relax, I aint a spammer and I havent sold my soul to the devil (yet). Your information is safe with me (heck! I dont think I will even remember if you left your identification or not!). Relax and write your comments without any fear of Big Brothers. 

<h3>Supported Browsers</h3>

This site looks and works the best in Safari or Firefox. You can also view it in IE 6. It has not been tested on Opera, Mozilla, Netscape, Konqueror and the unashamedly evil IE 5.
