Everybody has been talking about the <a href="htp://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> relaunch and I decided to try it out and find how well made it is. And so I was trying to sign up for a blog, when I landed on a "choose your template" page. And without seeing the names of the designers I could make out who designed what. Is Web Design an implicit art form? (oops too much of <a href="http://www.hbo.com/city/.">Sex And the City</a>). 

Anyways, as I said, I think web desginers have their own unique style that permeates through their entire portfolio. <a href="http://www.stopdesign.com">Douglas Bowman</a>, for example, uses the sharp dark blues much more than anyone else and <a href="http://www.simplebits.com">Dan Cederholm</a> manages to make eye blinding colours look good. <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com">MezzoBlue</a> uses different shades of similar colours with one stark contrasting colour (in his own website and in the blogger templates) or none at all (<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com">zengarden</a>). BUt Blogger looks too good now! 

P.S. I think the main blogger site is designed by <a href="http://www.whatdoiknow.org">Todd Dominey</a> and Douglas Bouwman.
