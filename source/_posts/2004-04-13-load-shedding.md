Omnious reflections of the Indian regular feature -load shedding -were cast upon this island when <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/">NTU</a> was engulfed in darkness unexpectedly. I was sitting in the community gathering hall (also called Canteen A) where the darkness was greeeted with fear and anxiety and lots of screams as the singaporeans, unused to being ruled by the King of Darkness, started fearing the beginning of the apocalypse. 

But the sharp thinking tamizh that me and my roomie are, the only matter that occupied our minds was the drying up of the water taps due to this power shut down and I got down to fill water on all containers I possessed.  So, many droughts in Madras are good in some ways after all, all ur survival tactics become reflex actions! :)

Oh.. in this hullabaloo I forgot, Happy Tamizh New Year!
