The silence is quite noisy I guess. So, I would rather clarify my lack of updates and also warn you that there wont be much happening till the end of June, when I intend to relaunch this site - for real. <br /><br />Meanwhile:<br /><br />I have been to Tokyo and it is a fabulous city and if you are a fashion freak you can spend your entire waking hours just gulping in the street fashion of the men and the women. And it is fairly easy to get around even if you dont know Japanese - just take the Lonely Planet with you!<br /><br />I have packed in more kilos thanks to absolutely no sense of exercise. <br /><br />I have almost forgotten how to write - shows how much blogging kept whatever writing skills I had alive!<br /><br />I have just bought an easel and a 24" LCD. Now I know why designers prefer the 24 inch. But sadly it is connected to the intel mac mini - which rules out photoshop :( <br /><br /><br /><b>So, the news is my blog is going to be dormant till the end of June, while I go under the hood and tinker with the fundamentals. <br /><br /></b>
