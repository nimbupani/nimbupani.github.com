<a href="http://www.adampolselli.com/colophon.php#me">This</a> guy is everything I want to be. I mean really. He is the guy who talks about colours.. and where I get ideas from. So, if I ever get anywhere close to even dishing out advice on colours, it will be thanks to him. Anyways, the point is, he has this beautiful section called <a href="http://www.adampolselli.com/getthelook/">get the look</a> where he puts down all that you need for your design stuff. So if you are a wannabe designer like me, go and drink it all up!
