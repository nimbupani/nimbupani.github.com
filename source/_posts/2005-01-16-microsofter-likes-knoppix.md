...as big a news as me liking a dog (er.. I HATE DOGS). Hats off to a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/devenkamp/archive/2005/01/10/350205.aspx">sensible microsofter! </a> I just hope Windows doesnt replicate it and start selling it to normal users! I just really hope it doesnt start slapping legal cases against others who do the same!
