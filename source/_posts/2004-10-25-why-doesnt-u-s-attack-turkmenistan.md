<a href="http://ashwink.net/blog">Ashwin</a> sent me this<a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1323246,00.html"> article in The Guardian Observer</a>, which details the horrors faced by the citizens of Turkmenistan. Horrible! I just can't imagine such a situation in the 21st century. Why isn't the U.S. taking pre-emptive measures to "save" the citizens, just like it wished to "save" iraqis?
