I have just recently planned my paintings which resulted in two good ones. Now, reading the Artists Manual is like finding a treasure house and I just cant wait to complete it and start painting with the new found knowledge of art resource management :) So now that the year is coming to an end here are a list of things I  am committed to doing:
<ul><li>One Graphic Illustration Per Week</li>
<li>One painting every two weeks</li>
<li>Gym every week</li>
<li>Swimming every two weeks</li>
<li>Be in communication with friends every two weeks (atleast!)</li>
<li>Participate in <a href="http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/001766.html">Word It</a> for December</li>
<li>Read the 10+ graphic design e-books and books by Jan 15th 2005</li>
<li>Set up automated backups and version control process for my illustrations and designs by next week</li>
<li>Review two artists works every month</li>
<li>Review a movie every week</li>
</ul>

That should be enough for now. And you, as my readers, do make sure I honour these words :)
