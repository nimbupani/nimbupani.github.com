My dad has a yellowing mathematics book written by a USSR mathematician. And the  problems were amazing and very interesting. But I guess I was slightly too late in realising it. Anyways, <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net">Brad</a> is definitely <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/cgi-bin/wiki.cgi?OneHundredInterestingMathCalculations">going to ensure</a> his kids know it much earlier than I did!

Read and have fun!
