Just when every Fashion Magazine That Matters (which has full sized ads of all the costliest brands on earth) started advising on how "full curls" are the summers rage, I decided to turn against the tide and go for a full rebonding. 

And I realised there are other attractive deals that comes with the package. Two guys for instance. No, no, you naughty fella, I mean two guys to hold two hair dryers to dry your eternally straight (for six months) and flying hair that, in the expensively decorated salon and with two hair dryers, makes you look like a cheap replica of Sushmita Sen in Main Hoon Na. 

And a lady who seems all honesty and sincerity when she fawns over my "virgin hair" - hair untouched before by any chemical. Now, my hair is no longer "virgin". Apparently "virgin hair" has a special appeal. Just like "virgin" humans, such hair is so hard to come by. 

The fact that the guys were also cute doesnt matter at all. Honest.
