My spies have again highlighted to me, the recent death of the founder of <a href="http://www.chupachups.com/">Chupa Chups</a> (flash required). I never knew that the Chupa Chups logo was designed by <a href="http://www.salvadordalimuseum.org/cgi-bin/SoftCart.exe/home.html?L+dali+mjmf6486+1072772695">Salvador Dali</a>!
People in India might not know of Chupa Chups, we have the wonderful loli-pops to compensate for that! :) 

<b>P.S.</b> this should be the last of the rapid fire entries :) I am leaving for India soon, so posts will be random and extremely rare! :)
