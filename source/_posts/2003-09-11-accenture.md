All the best brains of my batch applied to Accenture for Industrial Attachment (its a trend with the best brains of all batches :) ). The pay is too good. Some of them earn about S$2,000 with overtime pay and all that. Most of them are considered for a permanent job with Accenture too- a well paying one at that.

But the worst part is the work. Apparently its slave work. The people I know,  worked only on Microsoft Word throughout their Attachment period :) . And they had very strict deadlines, which meant working atleast till 1 a.m.  But most of them didnt mind coz of the fat pay check. And yeah, its the best way to make pots of money within the shortest period of time! :) 


But then, tales are going round about <a href="http://accenture.rediffblogs.com/">how Accenture treats the candidates who apply for jobs, in India</a>-with elimination rounds from 8.30 a.m. till atleast 11 p.m. in the night (atleast for those who qualify for the main interview).  But then, I guess its a way of preparing the candidates for a gruelling time ahead. I have heard tales, from the friends who worked in Accenture, about how people go without sleep for <b>days</b> and spend their waking hours in the CompanyHeadquarters or their offices.  Its not easy working in Accenture. Surely, the message gets through to the candidates with such a torturous day. 

But interestingly, in Singapore, I havent heard of candidates being selected for a job (by an MNC atleast) within a day! Accenture Singapore has several rounds of elimination which last for atleast <b> over a month </b>. Wonder why Accenture reserved the on-the-way-to-slaughter treatment for its Indian wing?
