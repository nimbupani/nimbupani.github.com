While I was drowning in work, I got this sticker in my mail day before.  A few seconds of humour in the sea of "busy"ness.

Meanwhile, I forgot to announce our temporary lodger Jace, who is temporarily camping at ashwink's room for a week before he heads back home! 

Also, my dear fridge has broken down, hours after I got groceries to stock up the fridge. I am having a hard time recollecting my mum's advice on fridge-less existence and storage of food. I do not see a point to living a life without a fridge :)
