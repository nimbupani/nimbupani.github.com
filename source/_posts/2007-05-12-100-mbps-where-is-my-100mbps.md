title: " 100 Mbps...Where is my 100Mbps"

<a href="http://starhub.com">Starhub</a> has advertised for long about its broadband 100Mbps pipe ("Feel the rush of 100 Mbps"). And given that I work extensively online on servers that are quite remote, this was like a dream come true. I was one of the earliest subscribers to this scheme.

However, since then, I have got much to regret about the service. I have had my modems replaced twice and each time I had to give up working for 2 days - wait for the service man to come and replace the modem. 

Today, however, it got worse. The modem just got replaced a few hours ago, and the new modem now stopped working. Thankfully, after much firm talk over the phone with an intelligent customer service guy on Friday (before the modem got replaced), I got them to provide me with the 100 Mbps internet service on my <a href="https://secure.starhub.com/shop/jfn?mfunc=73&octx=47.a0.45&jfnRC=4">Digital Voice modem</a> and this was still available - so I had it moved to my workspace and connected the router from there. So everything works - except for the loss of my landline.

Of course, you can imagine i was WILD. The customer service made it worse when I called after the newly replaced modem broke down. He refused to give me a time by when it will be fixed. He kept insisting the problem was with the signal cable point and not with the modem - but the digital voice cable modem works flawlessly when connected at the same point. I suspect, the problem is AGAIN with the modem - which would make it the FOURTH modem I have got replaced in the space of 2 months. 

I think it is the worst service I have got in Singapore so far. And to think I am subscribed to the <a href="https://secure.starhub.com/shop/jfn?entry=PROMODETAIL&promotionId=61477">maxonline "Ultimate"</a> which is the most expensive of the lot.
