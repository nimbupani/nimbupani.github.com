<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">Guardian</a> has an interesting <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1256469,00.html?=rss">article</a> on how people 'misuse' words. As I read the article, I realised, with growing horror, that I was one of those criminals! Especially the confusion over "rein" and"reign". And yes, it's a secret. Oops, did I make a mistake with the <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1256469,00.html?=rss">grocer's apostrophe</a>?
