I came to know of this wonderful artist <a href="http://www.miroslavsasek.com/books/index.html">Miroslav Sasek</a> through <a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net">Things Magazine</a>. Do go through the illustrations for his travel books on <a href="http://www.miroslavsasek.com/books/thisis/paris.html">Paris</a>, <a href="http://www.miroslavsasek.com/books/thisis/london.html">London</a>, <a href="http://www.miroslavsasek.com/books/thisis/rome.html">Rome</a> and <a href="http://www.miroslavsasek.com/books/thisis/newyork.html">New York</a>. Hilarious illustrations. Another master I intend to learn from :)

P.S. Go <a href="http://www.miroslavsasek.com/books/thisis/capekennedy.html">here</a> for what I think is the best illustration of the series
