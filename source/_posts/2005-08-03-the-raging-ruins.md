I went for dinner with <a href="http://swadesee.blogspot.com/">Badri</a> yesterday and for want of change and healthy lifestyle decided to try the <a href="http://www.yogihub.com.sg/intro.htm">Yogi Hub</a> at Boon Tat Street. Boon Tat Street is most famous for <a href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/what_to_see/landmarks_and_memorials/lau_pa_sat.html">Lau Pa Sat</a>, but I was shocked to see an old islamic style building boarded u p with "Danger" boards. 

Shocked to see Singapore Government has allowed a ruin to continue in the middle of the city without the typical Singaporean "brand new" look. Pleased to know that Singapore does have buildings that are ancient and not made to look new. Buildings that have stood the test of time and have made it successfully to the future. Buildings that indicate that Singapore was not a miracle city created by androids ( a la matrix) but a city that grew up through struggle and determination. 

Singapore does have a human face behind the plastic smile. 

P.S. Does anybody know what that building is?

<strong>Update</strong> Just found out from <a href="http://www.streetdirectory.com.sg/singaporemap/singaporemap.php?ismap=1&starmode=0&x=29604.871728241&y=29341.957922222&star=1&iconlist=star1,29604.871728241,29341.957922222;&searchcompany=&searchunitno=&searchblock=1&searchstreetname=Boon+Tat+Street&searchbuildingname=Telok+Ayer+Conservation+Area&searchpostalcode=069611&searchmasterid=3344&searchbuildingid=9010&level=6?193,250">Street Directory</a> that it is the <a href="http://coldfusion.singreweb.com.sg/location/along_nagore.html">Nagore Durga Shrine</a>, a mosque constructed by the migrants from Southern India.
