I have been catching up on a lot of books lately, all thanks to <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>. It was tedious at first but I am now loving it! I am mad about anything written in the 50s or earlier and many of them are available free. 

If you love books too, go here for a <a href="http://www.friedbeef.com/2007/04/09/best-places-to-get-free-books-the-ultimate-guide/">great list of websites to search and download free books from</a> (in case <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is not enough!). 

<h3>Download</h3>
If you are interested in downloading books in a format you prefer, you should look at <a href="http://manybooks.net/">ManyBooks.net</a>. Awesomely, you can get the books not just in PDFs but in dozens of other formats including for Kindle, iPhone, or other ebook readers. 

<h3>What to Read</h3>
Most Indians grow up with British authors and tend to end up liking british writing enormously - I am no different. I love reading all the age old British writers: <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/w#a783">Wodehouse</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/c#a80">G K Chesterton</a> (my favourite!), <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/p#a481">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/c#a451">Agatha Christie</a>, <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/d#a69">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> and<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/browse/authors/w#a30"> H G Wells</a>. 

I love science fiction as well, and Project Gutenberg has a great vintage <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Science_Fiction_(Bookshelf)">Science Fiction Book Shelf</a>. If you love Maths, read <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/97">Flatland: a romance of many dimensions</a>

<strong>Update:</strong> Internet Archive's Blog has an <a href="http://internetarchive.wordpress.com/category/cool-books/">awesome list of free e-books</a> (for children as well!). Check it out!
