I will be blogging weekly at <a href="http://naachgaana.com">Naachgaana</a> on the retro aspects of bollywood beginning with the King of Retro Bollywood - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0403826/">Nazir Hussain's</a> films. It will focus on the set and costume design while also dwelling on the typography, and other little things that make these movies timeless!
