title: " Lesbian by abuse?"

Ever since I watched the first half of this <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/showtime.asp?fodname=20040628">disgusting movie</a>, I have wondered why a lesbian's/gay's preferences need to be explained with a reason, as if they became lesbian/gay because they had <i>no other choice</i>. Even the movie <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0116308/">Fire</a> had to explain the lesbian relationship shared by Sita and Radha due to the loveless relationship they share with their respective husbands. And girlfriend takes the cake for outrageous "justification" for Tanya's "strange" liking for women. Apparently, she was abused as a child and hence her dislike for men and consequent love for women! And this is a reason which most of my friends agree with! Why should you look upon lesbians and gays as creatures deserving pity? Imagine the consequences for gay/lesbian rights when they are shown in this light! 

Why do Indian movies depict lesbian/gay relationships as if there was "no other choice"? Isn't it always <i>by choice</i>? In this context I think <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com/showtime.asp?fodname=20040119">Chameli</a> and <a href="http://www.indiafm.com/reviews/03/rules/index.shtml">Rules</a> should be given a standing ovation for correctly dealing with non-hetro sexual relationships.

P.S. <a href="http://psyphycom.blogspot.com">Naveen</a> has a <a href="http://pulaprebalakrishnan.net/gay/gayart1_p1.html">link</a> to an article written about the experiences of a gay.
