Fact: If you tell a person, overly conscious of his/her weight, "you are so thin!", that person will probably feel pleased. 

Fact: If you tell a person who looks so thin that he/she looks anorexic, "you are so thin!" that person will probably feel depressed.

The conclusion is, it isnt what the others say that make you happy. It is the state of mind you have created for your happiness.  The same sentence draws different states of pleasure from different persons. If you can master the trick of creating a state of happiness that does not depend on you waiting like a hawk for a word from others, there is nothing like it. Success is what you define of it. 

Most people define success and happiness by words that others tell them. But the words that others use need not mean exactly what is there in their hearts. There are so many other events that cloud a human mind, which colour every word we utter. One bad word from the mother/father/husband/wife/kid is enough to put us into foul mood which may propagate to the one word we utter which may hurt the person hung up on that one word for happiness or sadness. 

Hmm.. need to chew on this.
