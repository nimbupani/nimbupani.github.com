Dan Savage writes a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/salon/story/0,14752,1284875,00.html">very insightful article</a> on how the sanctity of marriage is violated when gay men marry women. There is no law prevent them from being married and being gay at the same time (as the <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=politicsNews&storyID=5964816">recent scandal</a> showed). Why not lift the ban on gay marriage and prevent such mockery of marriages (if that is the aim of the "ban on gay marriage")?
