Googling for Matthew Broderick brought me to <a href="http://www.jim-caruso.com/scrapbook_2/jc_sjp.htm">this</a>. If there is one photo to destroy the image that <a href="http://www.hbo.com/city/cast/actor/sarah_jessica_parker.shtml">Sarah Jessica Parker</a> has built, it is this one :). 

Oh, just realised, the one on the HBO site will be a close competitor too :)
