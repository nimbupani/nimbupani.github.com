I still retain a semblance of interest in all things J2ME. The <a href="http://www.enterprisej2me.com/blog/java/?postid=79">news</a> about Nokia and Vodafone taking the lead in developing the next generation J2ME architecture was a pleseant surprise. Plesant surprise because it will make J2ME slightly more platform independent than now. This means all java games that run on your mobile devices will be able to run on PDAs and other high end devices ( yeah, it isn't possible now.. no, you didnt know that, the java marketing machine never lets out its secrets). Hurray for Nokia!
