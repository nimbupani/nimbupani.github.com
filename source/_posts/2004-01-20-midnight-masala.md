My journey from the Chennai Airport to my house was quite uneventful (by Madras standards). But I just couldn't resist taking a photo of this 'restaurant'. Tonnes of such shops litter Madras roads. But while most go about by common proper nouns, a few of them turn out to have awesome names like this one in the picture.  Mostly, these shops start as tin and wood buildings which after handsome profits turn into brick and mortar buildings. It maybe illegal, but it is a good start towards prosperity.
