Iran <a href="http://www.iranfocus.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=80">executes</a> a sixteen year old girl and hindus and muslims <a href="http://in.news.yahoo.com/040815/137/2ficq.html">fight</a> at the drop of the hat. Where, where are the famed human values? Why doesnt U.S attack these perparators of human rights violation?
