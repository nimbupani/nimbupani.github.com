There is not a day in the history of NTU that has passed without some construction or the other going on in some parts of it.  The unfortunate part of such continuous tasks are the different types of architecture, through which you can predict when the building was planned. Another side effect is the mismash of weird colours. Right now the NTU Architects are fascinated by the color blue. The building you see in the background is the upcoming school iof Biological Sciences.
