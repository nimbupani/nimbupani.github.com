Have you ever looked at something and felt like that one moment vindicated your existence on earth? I did. I looked at "Creative Hands". 

Creative Hands, bless its existence, is a fine arts shop in Takashimaya Shopping Centre in Singapore. It sells THE STUFF that artists want. No, not those blasted "gold and silver included" 12 pathetic colored water colours and those withered brushes but ACTUAL paints. It sells Gouche, Acrylic, Oil paints and Water colours.  It actually sells fixatives AND dilutants. Whats more, IT SELLS CANVASES!!!!!! I bought my first canvas =) and my first water colour paper pad. I just can't wait to get dirty with paint!
