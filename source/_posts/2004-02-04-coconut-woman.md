I LOVE coconuts. And Chennai has loads of coconuts. Well, doesnt that picture convince you? Not if you are from <a href="http://www.kerala.com/">God's Own Country</a> (where there are jungles of coconut trees, I hear). But in a treeless city such as Madras, coconut trees provide the sparse shade and the necessary greenery. 

But coconut sales seem to be dwindling nowadays. Coconut vendors are now morphing into <a href="http://www.coltrane-electronics.com/tuktuk/images/india_02%20.jpg"> auto</a> drivers and carpenters. Oh well, I just hope people do not stop drinking coconut water all together. Or perhaps we shall have the <a href="http://www.coca-cola.com">soda manufacturers</a> offering coconut water in a can!
