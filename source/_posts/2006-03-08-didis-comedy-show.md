I suddednly remembered the great Didi's Comedy show that was the ONLY filler ever in DD before cable TV hit us. And <a href="http://tringtring.blogspot.com/2005/10/good-old-dd-days.html">prabhu caught the nostalgia bug before me</a>! Here is a link to <a href="http://www.didipage.de/html/videos.html">Didi's website</a> from Prabhu's post. 

I did like them then and didnt realise it was European and not American :) I love them now, for the quaint 70s-80s look :)
