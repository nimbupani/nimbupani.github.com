I was watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457875/">Ek Ajnabee</a> - one of those dustbin movies - when I realised that the movie's hero is none but the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amitabh_Bachchan">Big B</a>. I dont remember any actor who has succeeded as well as him in carrying an entire masala film on his own as an old man of 63. 

I just realised that the roles he gets these days are no different from those in the 70s - only he is older. Now, just like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000125/">Sean Connery</a>, he looks more charming with age, and does the Angry Old Man role! The only female actor who can match with such charisma and dignity at an old age would be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waheeda_Rehman">Waheeda Rehman</a>. But then, she hasnt acted much in recent years, but no one else in Indian Cinema have found fame and popularity playing themselves as old men AND heroes at the sametime! 

I am now a fan of Amitabh Bachchan.
