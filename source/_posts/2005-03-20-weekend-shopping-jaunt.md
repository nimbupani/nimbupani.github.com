It wasnt supposed to be one. It was supposed to be a F1 trip. But turned out that I shopped more than I ever did in the last two years. But the prices were so cheap that I actually didnt spend more than 100 dollars on the whole (including a coool new backpack which came under S$30!). 

More on the trip later. I met up with <a href="http://chetan.ckunte.com">Chetan</a> and <a href="http://umaipadam.blogspot.com">Maran</a>. Lovely time. KL is AWESOME. I hope Indian cities grow up to be somewhat similar to KL =).
