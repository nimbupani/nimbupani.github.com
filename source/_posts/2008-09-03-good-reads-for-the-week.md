I came across the blog of <a href="http://weblog.200ok.com.au/">Ben Buchanan</a> who has blogged about Opera frequently. Here are two great links from his blog:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://weblog.200ok.com.au/2008/07/adding-opera-buttons-for-dragonfly-and.html">Adding opera buttons for dragonfly and cache reload</a>
<p>Buttons to add to standard toolbars rather than access these functionalities through deeply buried menu items - provided you use those toolbars (I dont!)</p></li>
<li>
<a href="http://weblog.200ok.com.au/2008/08/ie8-not-defaulting-to-ie8-rendering.html">ie8 not defaulting to ie8 rendering after all</a>
<p>This has a great overview of the renewed uproar over IE8 Beta release that goes back on the promise of rendering IE8 as IE8 by default (it now renders as IE 7 for intranets and puts a "broken page" icon for standards mode rendering).</p>
</li>
</ul>
