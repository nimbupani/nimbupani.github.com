My dad had carefully saved these two illustrations of mine which were published in The Hindu Young World, twelve years ago. It seems like it just happened a few years ago! I remember showing it to my school principal with a shy embarassed smile and the thumping of my heart as I saw students crowding the school notice board to get a look at them!
