<a href="http://www.thingsmagazine.net/">Things Magazine</a> links to <a href="http://www.tomthomson.org/groupseven/index.html">Group of Seven</a>, an art 
group. Do view the amazing paintings in there. Much similar to the <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~kmh55/anonaiis.htm">Progressive Arts Movement</a> in India, but very different in ideology. While the GoS artists had a common interest in painting the Canadian north, the PAG artists were more free spirited and heralded the dawn of Indian Modern Art. 

I am also reminded of the Indian People's Theatre Movement, which had stars like <a href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=409548">Utpal Dutt</a>, <a href="http://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/bhishamsahni.html">Bhisham</a> Sahni and <a href="http://www.loc.gov/acq/ovop/delhi/salrp/kaifiazmi.html">Kaifi Azmi</a>. I think we should not forget the strong communist leanings of both PAG and IPTA.  Communism was good in some ways after all! :) 

On an unrelated note, <a href="http://www.bengalweb.com/culture/calmov2.html">this</a> is an interesting take on how Bengal has almost single handedly created the bollywood industry.

As per Swami's request, my take on <a href="http://www.akkthefilm.com/">AE</a> (warning: loud music): just copy <a href="http://www.raaga.com/channels/tamil/movie/T0000609.html">"Jana Gana Mana"</a> song somewhere and burn your AE CD. It is definitely not worth it.. <a href="http://www.hiponline.com/artist/music/a/aqua/">Aqua</a> would have done a better job and the music is as crappy as <a href="http://www.raajangahm.com/irbio.html">Illayaraja's</a> songs for <a href="http://www.parliamentofindia.nic.in/lok12/biodata/12tn38.htm">Ramarajan's</a> movies ( which invariably figure in the top ten worst movies ever made in the history of Tamil Film Industry).
