Aha! Our very own A.R. Rahman is composing the music for the <a href="http://www.thelordoftheringsmusical.com/">LOTR musical</a> to be put up on the West End theatre in a year's time. Meanwhile,<a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2004/03/one_night_in_or.html"> several</a> <a href="http://www.crookedtimber.org/archives/001510.html">people</a> have been second guessing the titles of songs that will feature in the musical. Go and have a look. I really liked "Don't cry for me Minas Tirith".
