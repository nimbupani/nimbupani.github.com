If you go along with me when you travel, it is likely that you might conclude that I am either deaf or dumb. I dont talk when I am in motion. Never. 

No it isnt like I have something against talking then. It is simply I love observing the world outside. Especially the typefaces. Now that I have enough knowledge to atleast distinguish among Helvetica, Futura, Arial and some other fonts. 

This apparently, is now influencing my movie watching as well. I watch retro movies and am smitten by how retro the look is, and the most important element that makes it all happen is the typeface used. The typeface on shops, on tea cups, on servettes, on spoons, on badges. Each of these make a difference. And they more or less decide the retro-ness of the scene (apart from the clothes of the actors).

So, in this regard, Mark Simonson has a <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/article/15/">very detailed observation on the typographic gaffes made in Titanic</a>. (I havent watched it yet!). 

This reminds me of my deep regret at not taking a digital camera to capture all the AMAZING typefaces that were used in shops in Chennai and mumbai. The ultimate kitsch type collection =( Next time, I will not travel without a camera!
