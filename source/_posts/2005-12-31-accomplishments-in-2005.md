To complete my experience of 2005, I need to put into words what worked and didnt about the year! So here are the lists for this year!

<strong>Accomplishments:</strong>
<ul><li>Created an intranet portal using <a href="http://drupal.org/">Drupal</a> a platform. Learned to install and set up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP">LAMP</a> system and troubleshooting upgrades to Apache, PHP, and Drupal.</li>
<li>Learned about usability and applied the principles in practice. Found that, as a programmer, there are so many usabilities practices you can lose sight of, in your excitement to program and reach the deadline! Also, learned that programmers dont care about usability, in general. In fact, nobody does, till they learn it the hard way.</li>
<li>Was offered a job in usability but turned it down.</li>
<li>Did the <a href="http://landmarkforum.com">Landmark Forum</a></li>
<li>Got back my friendship with the awesomest people on earth.</li>

</ul>

<strong>What is Missing:</strong>
<ul><li>Dedicated updates. I have not been vigilant enough to update this blog on a regular basis. I lost many leaders because of this.</li>
<li>A redesign. Has been on the pipeline for more than a year. It still continues to be.</li>
<li>Movie reviews. I have slacked off on my commitment to Naachgana. I havent written many posts there despite the popularity of my weekly updates.</li>
<li><a href="http://salonsolidarity.blogspot.com/">SalonSolidarity</a>. I joined this awesome group blog and have never been to an art gallery since. I am deeply embarassed by this action of mine. :( </li>
<li>Usability Posts. I had several in mind, but I never posted them anywhere</li>
<li><a href="http://www.publicgyan.com/">Public Gyan</a>. I havent taken any initiative in this awesome prediction market.</li>
<li>My Cambodia trip. Lots of planning, never got done</li>
<li>I also wanted to do graphic illustrations, but have managed only three.</li>
<li>Waking up early. Never managed to do that yet!</li></ul>
