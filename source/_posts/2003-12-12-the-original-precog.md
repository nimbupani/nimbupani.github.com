Do you know who was behind the whole idea of "What is real?" in the matrix?  Do you know who wrote Minority Report, Total Recall and now, the Paycheck?  Ah, you didn't . It was a poor man called <a href="http://wired.com/wired/archive/11.12/philip.html">Philip K. Dick</a>.  He was the first person to question reality and our definitions of that state. But, his foresight was not recognised and he died a poor man. Now his stories don't sell for less than $200 million. Bah, that's life.
