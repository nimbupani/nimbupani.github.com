For sixteen years of my life I had been taught about Jammu AND Kashmir being the "crown" of 'Bharat Mata', for the unique shape of that state. After coming to Singapore, I am puzzled by the representation of Jammu and Kashmir in Singapore newspapers. While "Jammu" is quite visibly in India's terrain, Kashmir is seen to be shared by China and Pakistan. I wondered and thought it was the "latest map" unlike the maps we got from "atlas" industries.But coming back home, I was surprised to see Indian magazines representing India with Kashmir firmly in India's hands. 

Why this misrepresentation? What are we trying to achieve by showing an age old map which does not represent the current reality? It is indeed sad that India can no longer be the proud owner of the "crown", but is it not the fault of fifty years of passive governance? why should we keep thinking of the days gone by?
