After much prodding, Swami has started a <a href="http://chaami.blogspot.com">blog</a>. Finally, he finds a good use of the continuous free time at office! But be warned -its Swami and he speaks a lot! and if you arent prepared to read something funny then you might be content enough to visit <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com">this</a> morbid site :)

Naveen too has started to <a href="http://psyphycom.blogspot.com/">blog</a> after much deliberation.  His site is wonderfully interesting array of ideas. He is the most curious eager beaver I have ever seen :).
