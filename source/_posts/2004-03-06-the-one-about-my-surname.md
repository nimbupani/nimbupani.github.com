I have no idea why people are so curious about where I come from. Maybe its because of my suspicious surname. Apparently many mallus have "Manian" as their surname ( thats what one of the confused strangers told me afterwards :)). 

Strangers get throughly confused with my surname which is why one of the first questions they ask me is "Unnaku Tamizh Teriuma?" ('Do you know tamil?' in tamil) or the more confident among them will pour forth verses in a beautiful language (=malayalam). 

Ah, well I thought all this would end in Singapore, where I can have only one classification:Indian. But apparently not. A few months ago, when I went to visit Deepak in the hospital, one of the doctors asked er.. told me 'You malay". Bah!
