...Remo Fernandez at Starbucks in Raffles City Shopping Centre! I couldnt believe my eyes =) I saw an old man with shoulder length hair and spectacles who looked like Remo Fernandez, talking to two women. Whew! I was so scared to go and find out if he really was Remo! I gathered courage, confronted the fear and just went upto him and asked if he was Remo. And he WAS! 

I was soo thrilled =) And he was on a holiday, and might be coming back for a concert!He looked tired and well, unlike the enthusiastic guy we have seen on T.V. Sigh...thats life I guess. One thing I realised was he was SUCH A NORMAL GUY =) I mean there were all these singaporeans and foreigners totally oblivious to his celebrity status =) and it just looked like I was meeting a friend! 

With him was the Vice President of Zee Network, so she wants to know the ground support for Remo. I was totally into going for his concert, anybody else interested? They would like to hold a concert for him here. And I think he deserves one :P
