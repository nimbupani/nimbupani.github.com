And how do blogs 'die'? 
The comment above, believes that blogs exist as shortcuts to e-fame. But really, blogs are pages for your personal expression and for a few others who matter. A blog may be like your kid's first sketch of Mickey Mouse thats framed in your drawing room. Come what may, you wouldnt like to throw the 'masterpiece' out of your room. Creations which others view with disdain but which you are extremely proud of. A blog can't die unless the owner wants it to. Sometimes, blogs are like online personal diaries. Blogs provide a personal perspective to the world's happenings. You can't not read what a guy from Afganistan has to say about Talibans (more interesting if he turns out to be one of them) or what an Iraqi has to say about Americans. Moreover, you get to hear the real story. From the horse's mouth.

I would like to believe that blogs exist for the sake of exisiting - a form of personal expression. Blogs needn't be 'Blog Portals'. If they become 'Portals' they lose the identity of a blog. I guess blog portals would be better off as a Forum with the Moderator being the author of the 'Portal'. When the personal touch vanishes so will the blog.
