I submitted my site, on a whim, to the cream of the CSS design showcase sites about two months ago. About a week ago I noticed through Google Alerts that my website has been linked from so many of these galleries including: <a href="http://www.cssprincess.com/personal/nimbupani-designs/">CSS Princess</a> (yay!), <a href="http://www.webcreme.com/2008/02/nimbupani-designs/">Web Creme</a>, <a href="http://screenfluent.com/view/www.nimbupani.com">Screenfluent</a>, <a href="http://cssmania.com/galleries/2008/02/27/nimbupani-designs.php">CSS Mania</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/guspim/2295917296/">Guspim's Design Solutions Patterns sets</a>, <a href="http://bestwebgallery.com/2008/03/03/nimbupani/">Best Web Gallery</a> (managed by the awesome <a href="http://www.ndesign-studio.com/">ndesign-studio</a>).
