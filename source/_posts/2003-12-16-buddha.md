I just created two <a href="http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/c/collage.html">collages</a> out of free <a href="http://www.zocard.com/index1.html">postcards</a> (Warning: The site uses some loud music) kept outside the Coffee Club Express in my <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg">University</a>. I have no idea what the Chinese script means :). I hope it is not something offensive! :|
