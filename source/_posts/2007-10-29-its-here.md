The portfolio page which has been a year in the making - is finally <a href="http://nimbupani.com">here</a>! 

It is a static page with some ajaxy goodness (the contact section) and some <abbr title="Portable Network Graphic">PNG</abbr>s for backgrounds (I have a wild idea of replacing the background image with some of my own illustrations - justifying using the transparent PNGs). Obviously using PNGs causes IE 6 to display the PNGs with an ugly grey background - for which there is a <a href="http://www.twinhelix.com/css/iepngfix/">fix</a> - but the fix has limitations. Hence, currently, none of the links are clickable on IE 6 :( But I am still breaking my head about it. 

The next step is to upgrade my<a href="http://www.movabletype.org"> MovableType</a> and then apply the design to that too.
