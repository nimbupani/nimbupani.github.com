Yeah, I got ten seconds of fledgling interest in cooking. And made my first beans curry (or 'kai' as some <a href="http://in.groups.yahoo.com/group/tambrahm/">tambrahms</a> say). Came out quite well except for slightly too much salt for my taste. So the interest has now quietly exited to the background to rear its ugly head some other time.
