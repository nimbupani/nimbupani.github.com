Last night's surfing has given me two new types of blogs:

<ul><li><a href="http://foreword.ospreydesign.com/">Foreword</a> - A blog for book design and other titbits about books.</li>
<li><a href="http://sketchblog.verunne.net/">Sketchblog</a> - I wish I could sketch like that!</li></ul>

Interesting how blogs fill up areas that have hardly found mention in BB (Before Blogs) Internet era.
