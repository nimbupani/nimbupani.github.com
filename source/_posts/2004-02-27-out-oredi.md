Singapore has its own unique English grammar. Instead of using 'Is it possible to do this?' or "Will you do this for me?", Singaporeans use the very simple "can or not?" . Deepak had a very funny experience, where a person serving him at the canteen explained how food got over before Deepak's order could be served: "They come-come oredi, they take-take oredi".  

The fact is, most people think in their native language. I suspect this funny use of English is due to the literal translations that many people do from their native language to English.  

The overuse of 'already' and 'only' is reflected in the picture above. Or perhaps it was less costly to write 'out only' instead of 'Exit' :P
