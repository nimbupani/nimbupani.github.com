This is my newly decorated softboard. I would love to claim all the beautiful paintings that you can see as my masterpieces, but I would rather give the masters and C.R.Y the credit. These are the <a href="http://www.cry.org/home/crycards/crycards.asp">C.R.Y Cards</a> that I found too good to resist.  At the right bottom, you can see <a href="http://nimbupani.com">this</a> devil being propped up by the Mother. Of course, to the left of that you see my Hero- my Grandpa (its truly my grandpa's picture and not a shot from some Hollywood war movie).  In case you are wondering about the toothless oldie, he is the result of my first experience with a stylus.
