I read about the sorry plight of <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=Maher+Arar&hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&start=30&sa=N">Maher Arar</a> in <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/index.html">Brad DeLong's blog</a>. I was eager to know the reactions of the most vocal supporter of War Against Terror -<a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>. But, curiously, there was no article in the whole of the CNN website that mentions this episode, nor does the <a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&lr=&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Maher+Arar+%2Bcnn">google</a> seem to have a cache of any such article on CNN. Perhaps they don't want to expose their readers to the unsavoury episodes of War Against Terror?
