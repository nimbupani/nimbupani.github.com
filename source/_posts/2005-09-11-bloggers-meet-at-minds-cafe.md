We met yesterday at a little known comfortable cafe called <a href="http://www.themindcafe.com.sg/">The Mind's Cafe</a>. A few of them had already made themselves home at the venue while people kept trooping in. 

It was refreshing to see new faces and new blogs! The Celebrity who I invited to join - <a href="http://fpstwins.rediffblogs.com">Chetan Bhagat</a> - came! and it was awesome to share with him about his first book and the upcoming one! He has a very beautiful wife Anusha (who should hopefully start blogging soon!). 

We also had another non-blogger Sunil (who just Stands Out because of his height!) who is into podcasting! <a href="http://preetamrai.com">Preetam</a> as usual was fascinating us with his stories and tales while I caught up with <a href="http://Sadagopan.net">Sadagopan</a>, <a href="http://krossed.blogspot.com">Marasim</a>, <a href="http://queenofspices.blogspot.com">Anispice</a>, <a href="http://sambharmafia.blogspot.com">Kaps</a> and <a href="http://Mitokondrion.blogspot.com">Mitokondrion</a>. 

<a href="http://opinion.paifamily.com">Nitin</a> dropped by later coz of his blogging assignments =D (which just goes to show how dedicated he is!). Later, as the evening drew to a close, several made their way to the National Library and a few of us headed to Dhoby Ghaut for some dinner.

It was a fun evening with lots of people. But next time we better orgazine some calorie burning activity instead of a normal gathering =D (for my selfish interest of course =D).
