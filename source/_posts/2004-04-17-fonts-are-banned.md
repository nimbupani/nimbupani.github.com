[via <a href="http://journal.aiga.org/content.cfm?ContentAlias=%5Fgetfullarticle&aid=%23%2E%5EG%2F%0A">AIGA</a>]  Guess this is <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1034726.htm">old news</a>, but the "long arm of the law" touches typefaces too! Bah! I don't know why they are bothered, after all <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/911.commission/">nobody</a> reads those things.
