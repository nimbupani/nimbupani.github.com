An awesome <a href="http://typophile.com/node/17398">discussion on the typographic bungling</a> of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/lost/">Lost</a> is on at <a href="http://typophile.com">Typophile</a>. The discussion also veers towards the signs used in Lost. 

I didnt notice it much, but it is so weird that atleast three different typefaces are used for the title! Aick.
