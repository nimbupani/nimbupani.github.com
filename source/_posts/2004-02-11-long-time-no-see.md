Oh well a long hiatus. Was it worth it? I am not sure. I wanted to post so many things.. but now my computer turns into an albatross (er.. read <a href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/stc/Coleridge/poems/Rime_Ancient_Mariner.html">'The Rime of the Ancient Mariner'</a>) every two hours, preventing my creative juices from mixing smoothly. 

My projects are chugging along and I am loving every moment of Computer Vision and Image Processing. Of course, my admiration for economics is growing. 

A useless post deserves a useless ending. So here it goes.. The End.
