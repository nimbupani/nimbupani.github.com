I think for the first time in the history of India cinema we have actors who have <i>acted</i>, a wee bit theaterical but nonetheless it was excellence that was on display. 

The film starts with an amazingly touching voice over by Rani Mukherjee with a black screen where she asks "how long can you live like this? minutes, hours? I live like this all my life." (pardon my poor translation). 

I wouldnt like to bore you with the story line but I really liked the fact that this film covers some unknown territory unlike any other movie about the deaf and blind.  Nobody has ever asked whether the blind have any sexual aspirations, we assume they have no right to, which is very heartless. But this movie has very poignantly raised that question and left the answer for us to interpret. 

I was astounded to know Amitabh Bachchan can act. I didnt know he had it in him to execute this role to perfection. He has beaten all hollywood stars hollow in this movie. I think he should win the Oscar for Best Actor (I know I know it is impossible, but I think he deserves one). 

So get your asses off and grab the once in a lifetime opportunity of watching a real good hindi movie.
