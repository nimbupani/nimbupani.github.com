Two years ago, I discovered that I could almost paint with pastels. I loved pastels coz they were not as messy as the watercolors or poster colors and I had a better grip on them. So from then on, I made a series of paintings. Most of them were at home in Chennai where I think the hot weather is most conducive to creativity ;)
