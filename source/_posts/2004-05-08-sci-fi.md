Did you know that a <a href="http://www.hugogernsback.com">Mr.Hugo Gernsback</a> was the inventor of the phrase "Science Fiction"? More importantly he was the guy who started the first geeky magazine called "Modern Electrics". And wait, he didn't stop at that! He predicted how technology will change the future. All this around 1930s and 40s. 

There were others who indulged in such fantasies too (remember the clunky computers in  the year 2035 as shown in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114746/">Twelve Monkeys</a>?). And all these "predictions" are wonderfully organized in <a href="http://www.davidszondy.com/future/futurepast.htm">Tales of The Future Past.</a> (via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113064/">The Cartoonist</a>. Its quite interesting to revist the past and see what your ancestors thought of the future and laugh at their efforts.
