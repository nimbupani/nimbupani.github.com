<p>It took me 2 weeks to get over jet lag from my marathon India trip. So, there are less books to review as I was finally sane enough to do other stuff :) </p> 
<ul>
	<li><h3>Chameleon Days</h3>
	<p>This is the narration of the author's childhood experiences growing up in Ethiopia as a son of evangelist parents. It was an engrossing read which also describes some of the work that evangelical missions do. No, it did not alter my perspective of religious evangelism. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618658696?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0618658696">Chameleon Days: An American Boyhood in Ethiopia</a> certainly did not convey anything interesting about Ethiopia either.</p> 
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>The Arrival</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0439895294?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0439895294">The Arrival</a> is the first wordless Graphic Novel I read. The novel is set in a fantasy world where a man leaves his family to seek his fortune in a strange city. I am amazed at how many thoughts about belonging, culture and immigration that Shaun managed to convey without using any words. If you are an immigrant, you would love "reading" The Arrival.</p> 		
	</li>                               
	<li>
		<h3>The Complete Crumb Comics, Vol. 17</h3>
		<p>This is my attempt at reading all works by Robert Crumb, the fantastic comic book artist. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1560975377?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1560975377">The Complete Crumb Comics, Vol. 17: Cave Wimp</a> is funny and irreverent like the cover promises.</p>		
	</li>      
	<li>
		<h3>Designing the moment</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321535081?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0321535081">Designing the Moment: Web Interface Design Concepts in Action</a> is a book by Robert Hoekman Jr. who spoke at An Event Apart Seattle 2009. Most of it seems &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; to me, but I know many people might not think so.</p>

</ul>
<p>As usual, here is a plea for you to recommend interesting books you read recently!</p>
