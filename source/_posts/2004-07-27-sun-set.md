I get confused when I go to Java's website, is it sun.java.com or java.sun.com. Eventually I realised that Java was one of the MANY products of Sun, which I didnt know tilll a few years ago. The fact that Sun is so closely identified with Java shows what depths it has fallen into. 

I am not speaking as an expert tracker of Sun's ups and downs, but merely as an observer of a torrent of news about Sun's mounting losses and its settlement with Microsoft for mere money. 

I started following java more eagerly while doing my Final year Project.  By then, I was already disillusioned with the lack of information on Sun's website about its J2ME Configurations. Sun was leading the pack in promoting small-memory footprint configurations of J2ME when the whole world was excited about the larger footprint configuration CDC. While the storage costs and volume are shrinking day by day, Sun seems to be following the pooposit path in evangelising the configuration for the smaller devices with lesser memory. 

It isnt just that, the Sun's website had fewer and least informative articles while I found more compelling articles on IBM Developer. Worse, the forums are scattered with unanswered questions (you can see three of mine if you google nimbupani :)).
