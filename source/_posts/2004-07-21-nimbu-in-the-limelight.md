<a href="http://mdeii.blogspot.com">Anand</a> was the first to point out my letter being published in <a href="http://www.outlookindia.com">Outlook</a>. I could see the editors touch all over my <a href="http://outlookindia.com/rants.asp?date=07/26/2004&type=magazine&pn=2">letter</a> that shows me as someone british enough to use the word "<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=appalling">Appalling</a>" (I actually wrote "disgusting" :) ) and with a disorder of speaking as if writing a telegram. But, nevertheless, the letter brought a few minutes of happiness into the placid lives of my parents :) :)
