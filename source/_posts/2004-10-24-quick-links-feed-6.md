After reading <a href="http://www.andybudd.com/archives/2004/10/bookmark_management_faceted_classification_and_intelligent_agents/">Andy Budd</a> I was all the more tempted to try <a href="del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>. So I registered and created an <a href="http://del.icio.us/nimbupani">account</a>. I then poked around a bit to find out how I can post the del.icio.us links to my website. Found an <a href="http://www.veen.com/jeff/delicious-tutorial.html">awesome article</a> by <a href="http://veen.com/jeff">Jeff Veen</a>, and voila! my quick links section was up in two minutes. Check out the <strong>Quick Links</strong> on my sidebar. Finally, the tired and weary travellers to my website can take heart in seeing some thing new everytime (unlike my present state of "here-now-gone-in-two-seconds"). 

[I know I know, my website is badly, badly in need of a redesign, what with such a cluttered interface and what not. "Soon" is all I can promise as of now.]
