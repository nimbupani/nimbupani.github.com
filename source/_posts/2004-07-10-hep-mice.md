<a href="http://www.cnet.com">CNET.com</a> is <a href="http://news.com.com/Microsoft+dresses+up+mice/210-1001_3-5261241.html?part=rss&tag=5261241&subj=news.1001.20">reporting</a> on the designer mice developed by Microsoft. These stylish mice were designed by the famous industrial designer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Starck">Philippe Strack</a>. Though the new designs are suspiciously similar to the <a href="http://www.welovemacs.com/imacusbmice.html">Mac mice</a>, they look ultra hep and cool. Finally Microsoft is trying (in vain?) to capture the attention of designers and fashion conscious ;).
