I generally don't like watching serials. I have this hatred for such stuff ever since I watched the first few episodes of Junoon and puked (well, I would have, if given a chance!).  Now I have a fanatical respects for the directors and story-writers of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/index.html">Scrub</a>s. Every episode is filled with situations from daily life.. stories that you and me can relate to. 

It is a story of no absolutes, like in real life- where you can blame your boss as much as you can blame <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/bios/Dr._Bob_Kelso.html">Dr. Bob</a>. Oh, I adore the sarcasm that drips from every word that <a href="http://www.nbc.com/Scrubs/bios/Dr._Perry_Cox.html">Dr. Cox</a> utters. Its a good series you shouldnt miss out on.   

P.S. You have to watch it for its excellent soundtrack. And for its theme song.
