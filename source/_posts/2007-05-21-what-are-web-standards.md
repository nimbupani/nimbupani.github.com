<a href="http://www.robertnyman.com">Robert's Talk</a> has an <a href="http://www.robertnyman.com/2007/05/21/what-are-web-standards-a-comprehensive-explanation-of-what-is-comprised-in-the-term/">excellent post on what "web standards" mean and provides excellent links for further reading</a>. Must read for people like me, who have a very good "idea" of what web standards are but never did an in-depth research!
