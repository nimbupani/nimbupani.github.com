Whew! That was a tough one week! =( My itch to blog even though was completely absent during the weekdays but I found too many wonderful things that I couldnt wait to start blogging about during the weekend (Which includes fridays for me =D):

<strong>My Little Black Dress</strong> Yes! Yes! I did it! It was a vision of thousand exploding stars when I chanced upon my little black dress! And thanks to <a href="http://antrix.net">Deepak</a> (too many deepaks in the blogosphere these days), I could get it at an affordable price! YAY! YAY! YAY! (Er...I mean, he sponsored 50% of it due to a generous gesture of gifting me a Robinson's voucher for my birthday!). I know the occasions that demand a black dress on my part would be very very few and very far between (by that time another occasion draws near, I may actually become "healthier" than my LBD can afford me to be!). But in the eyes of the besotted It Does Not Matter. The first occasion I can see coming is the <a href="http://www.singaporewritersfest.com.sg/festival.php?c=1">Bloggers Nite</a>. Do make me feel good by dropping by and saying "Wowwww...I want that Black Dress!"

<strong>Band Names as Brand Names</strong> <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak">AdFreak</a> has an insightful entry on how <a href="http://adweek.blogs.com/adfreak/2005/08/what_if_there_w.html">Band Names transfers to Brand Names</a>. I love names as Eminem, 50 Cents, Sting, U2, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, Savage Garden, The Police, Bee Gees, and Beatles. Interestingly some of them have been translated to highly successful brand names. As, AdFreak sorrowfully writes, several bands have taken to names that would turn a wordsmith in his grave: "My Dog Has Hitler's Brain" !!! God help them! 

<strong>Sketching in Full Swing</strong>The past few days I have been sketching everything my eyes can rest on - Which results in some murky sketches of my friends and unknown strangers. Check out <a href="http://nimbupani.com/portfolio/archives/2005/08/27/random_things.php">two</a> of <a href="http://nimbupani.com/portfolio/archives/2005/08/27/random_faces.php">them</a> in my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/portfolio">portfolio</a>.
