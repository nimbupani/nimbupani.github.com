Is it simply a product of hype or is there an element of truth to the Banglore symdrome is something that I don't know. But apparently <a href="http://news.com.com/Amazon+details+Indian+operations/21w-M1038_3-5607122.html?part=rss&tag=5606366&subj=news">Amazon thinks Bangalore is the place to be</a>. Amazon has an office at Bangalore now! I hope they start offering free shipping within India or something!
