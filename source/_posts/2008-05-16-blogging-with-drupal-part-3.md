<p>Lhmdesign has an <a href="http://mydrupalblog.lhmdesign.com/lhmdesign-redesign-write">excellent write-up</a> on how the website was redesigned with Drupal with great tips for bloggers using Drupal. A couple of tips I found extremely useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Listing categories in a sidebar</strong> - Create a custom block and set the input type to &ldquo;PHP Code&rdquo; and use <a href="http://tela-web.com/drupal/another-taxonomy-term-list-for-drupal/comment-page-1/#comments">this code to list categories</a>
</li>
<li><strong>Removing &quot;not verified&quot; from guest comments</strong> - Drupal puts a &quot;not verified&quot; text next to the name of the comment author if the author is not a registered user. Here is <a href="http://www.mattfarina.com/2007/04/12/removing-not-verified-anonymous-users">how to remove &ldquo;not verified&rdquo; text if you are using phpTemplate as your theme engine</a>.</li>
</ul>
