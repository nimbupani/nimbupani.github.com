I came across <a href="http://pongo.motime.com/">this </a> interesting site and relived good old memories of clay modelling in childhood.  My mom used to find all sorts of plastic clay (mostly green, red and blue) and I used to make chairs and see-saws :). I won the clay-modelling prize in third standard (I still have the certificate if you don't believe me :P ). 

I am not sure, if kids still engage in clay-modelling. But it was sure good fun twirling the remaining pieces into a gooey snake and squashing that with my fat square palm!
