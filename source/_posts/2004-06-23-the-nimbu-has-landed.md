I reached the island day before. But as I am now no longer a recepient of free internet and non stop entertainment of the university (now that I have established myself fimly into the house) I was quite cut off for two days without internet. and that sucks. But anyways now I have made it a point to reach the university and surf the free internet the whole day and then pack my belongings and get back.  I am hoping my housemates will shift in much before that time and we can have internet and cable connection. Till then posts will be intermittent.
