It was an entry in Tomorrow.sg that made me download <a href="http://earth.google.com/">Google Earth</a> and try it out. Boy! It is a MARVEL! I spent two hours locating places I knew in Singapore and finding out how far apart they actually were and how much of an exercise my legs go through and justifying why I shouldnt be doing more at the gym. Try out Google Earth. It is time well spent! 

<strong>I ponder:</strong>

if you could create a flash tour out of google earth from one end of the Singapore to the other! That would be fun! 

What about maps for the jurong area of Singapore? I cant zoom into where I stay! =( 

Are the maps live? How old are these? 

<strong>What about creating a community to edit and collaborate on a map?</strong> That would be fun too! Imaging planning a trip with friends and getting to discuss on places through the bird's eye view of Google Maps! 

<strong>I Heart Google Earth! </strong>
