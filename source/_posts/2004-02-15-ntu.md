I wonder why nobody writes about Nanyang Technological University anywhere. I mean it is quite a decent university and the only technological university in Singapore!(yeah beat that!). Well I mean everyone of us (me, ex-blogger deepak and nan) always seem to focus on ourlives and NTU hovers somewhere around the background like an wannabe extra in a bollywood film (my idioms are awful). 

Anyways, so all ye readers,  behold the splendour of Nanyang Technological University. No wait, that link goes to the University that I will study in my next life (yeah I will make sure I do enough good to earn that previledge).  Well, here it goes, my university.
