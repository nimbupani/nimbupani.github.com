<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/presenters/playsitagain/access.shtml">6 Music Plays It Again</a> has put up some fo the finest BBC radio documentaries on Rock and Alternative music from 60s onwards. The quality of recording is excellent and with my awesome <a href="http://www.starhub.com/online/maxonline/tellmeabout/sharedvsdedi.html">3Mbps broadband connection</a>, it seems like I am hearing it on the radio!

Right now I am listening to a documentary on Red Hot Chilli Peppers. Do you know that Flea was a trumpet player for the LA Philharmonic Orchestra and that his mother lent her voice for "Under the Bridge" song? Can't wait to listen to the 60s archives with some rare sessions with David Bowie, Jimi Hendrix and Rolling Stones!
