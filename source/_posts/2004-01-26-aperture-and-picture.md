Ah, beware you photo experts, I am going to join your land soon. And why? Coz, the whole mumbo-jumbo about aperture and exposure was just explained in my Computer Vision and Image Processing lecture today! 
Oh boy, what wonders can good lecturers do to you! Today was the best 'technical' lecture I have heard from a NTU lecturer. 

So, what did he say that is making me jump with joy? Well, he put forth the expert photo speak in simple language! Okay, now I know how people can focus on a flower making the rest a distant blur. You just got to adjust the aperture! Or else you adjust the focal length. But when you reduce the aperture, less light goes into the camera lens(s)(the image isnt bright) so you need to have slow shutter speed to let in maximum amount of light. 

This aperture-light combo works in humans too. The pupil reduces in size when you in a brightly lit area (to reduce the intensity of light entering your eye, as there is too much light!) while when you are in a dark room, your pupil size increases to absorb the maximum amount of light available (as there is too less light for you to see).

Ah, you see the light? Awesome stuff. Apparently for maximum sharpness, pin hole cameras are the best.. I am now <a href="http://www.kodak.com/global/en/consumer/education/lessonPlans/pinholeCamera/pinholeCanBox.shtml">trying to build one</a>! :)
