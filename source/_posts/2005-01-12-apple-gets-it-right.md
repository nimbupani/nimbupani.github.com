YAY!!!! I cant tell you how thrilled I am to see the US$500 MacMini. Looks BEAUTIFUL and must be working excellently too. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/01/11.html#a9176">Scoble </a>seems to be think that it will be expensive on the whole as it doesnt come with the monitor and keyboard. But I think he is wrong. The MacMini is targeting PC users. And PC Users own monitors and keyboards.  So lets attack that argument:

Firstly, normal people have the basic knowledge of connecting keyboard, mouse and monitors to the box. And all the peripherals mentioned above last much much longer than the components inside the box.  So most people would love to switch to a small box that just completely replaces the troublesome CPU (which also makes as much noise as a continuously braying donkey).  

Secondly. in my experience, the idiot box at home (and I DO mean the PC) has several failures every six months and it isnt something that is easy to carry to give for repair nor would my parents even think of tinkering with the box.  Now enter MacMini: my parents save on space, hassle of transport and even do not have to worry about dust entering the casing! 

Oh, all the above applies to my home in Singapore too! 

And the super best part? It doesnt come with the buggy browser that is the honeypot for every possible virus on earth! 

The best part of the MacMini is the features it packs within the small box. I think you would have known the infamous Apple Cube which sunk without a trace. Macmini looks similar in some sense to that (the squarish looks). But more compact and elegant.  Do I hear the funeral chants for the PC?
