It may sound weird, but this sketch actually looks better in the original than through the camera. Guess it is my shaky hands to be blamed! 

Meanwhile, congrats to my mums who has won the Best Letter of the Day award from <a href="http://www.deccan.com/chennaichronicle/home/index.asp">Deccan Chronicle</a> for her letter which was published in the City Chronicle this Sunday! Keep writing mums!
