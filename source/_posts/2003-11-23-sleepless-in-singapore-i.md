<a href="http://www.fullertonhotel.com/">Fullerton Hotel</a> is one of the few surviving relics from the past. (Ahem, the past, as far as Singapore is concerned, starts only with the <a href="http://user.itl.net/~glen/BritishinSingapore&Malaya.html">invasion</a> by Great Britain).

I took this snap yesterday with <a href="http://vyom.org/cat_musings/burning_cash.php">Deepak's Camera</a>. I always wonder about the amount of electricity that go to waste through such delightful lighting up of the Singapore skyline. Perhaps that is why there are frequent power outages in my hall. Grr..
