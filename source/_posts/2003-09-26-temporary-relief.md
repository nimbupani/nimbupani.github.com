Whew, One obstacle out of the way. I submitted my resume today to <a href="http://www.ncs.com.sg">NCS</a>. You can get more on resume masala <a href="http://vyom.org/cat_general/rsum_time.php">here</a>. 

On a separate note, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/25/obituaries/25CND-SAID.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5062&en=fdee6033bbfb9bd1&ex=1065153600&partner=GOOGLE">Edward Said is dead</a> (Registration is required). Wham, there goes another good political commentator. Wonder where will Palestinieans find another replacement as eloquent as him. 
Meanwhile, MTV has a GIF animation of <a href="http://www.mtvindia.com/mtv/movies/twomin/">Spiderman doing curious Bollywood dancing steps</a>. A google search shows that it used to be a rage before I became an internet addict.
