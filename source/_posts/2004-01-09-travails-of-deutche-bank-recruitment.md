I didn't want to write about it. But I can't bear more insults anymore, so here I go. 
One fine morning, I wake up to submit the Deutche Bank online application form through <a href="http://www.kprime.org/about.htm">Konetic Recruitment Systems</a>. I went through the special effort of finding out which company made the on-line recruitment form because of the lack of ANY use of usability guidlines. Well, it sucked basically. There was no way I could undo any mistake or if I forget to attach a resume my application will be more worthy in a garbage dump.  Oh well, with a few letters missing (case of a wrong copy-paste), I submitted my resume and cover letter AND answered some five questions which technically would be more useful in an interview.

Yeah, coming to those questions. There were questions like 'Why do you want to work for Deutsche Bank' and the topper -"What should Deutsche Bank do to remain competitive?". Oh dear, my batchmates actually asked their dads to write in the answer for them! He he.. I never get tired of laughing at that!
Questions that should ideally be asked in an interview (atleast the screening one) were asked in this.
