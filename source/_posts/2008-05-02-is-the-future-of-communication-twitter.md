title: Is the future of communication twitter?

<p>Just had a epiphany while reading <a href="http://tantek.pbwiki.com/CommunicationProtocols">Tantek &Ccedil;elik&rsquo;s Communication Protocols</a>. A lot of people are complaining about <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/03/23/a-crisis-in-communication/">the inefficiency of emails</a>. What if we read emails like we read <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter</a> statuses? What if we have e-mails incorporated as direct messages with file attachments as links?</p><p>The strength of twitter is the limit to 140 characters. If we force people to use twitter-like email clients (or a client that can provide a twitter interface), it will make people think twice before emailing anything - and email only what is necessary. </p><p>I see a great opportunity in this, at least I will use it, if it comes up in the market! :) </p>
