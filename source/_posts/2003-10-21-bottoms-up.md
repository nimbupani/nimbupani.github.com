What do you say about a prof who encourages you to drink by buying you free beer, gin, red and white wine? Well, nothing except "Cheers!" :)
My FMI tutor ( read about him <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2003/09/19/asian_financial_crisis_1997.html"> here</a>), held the last tutorial in the NTU Staff Club (which is the pub in NTU). Here, he treated all of us to a gala free drinks session. Of course, most of the students were goodie goodie guys and girls ( yeah, me too!) - which explained our hesitation in gulping down glass after glass of alcoholic drinks. 

But yeah! a good ending to a glorious semester of Financial Management and Institutions!

P.S: Yeah, I am still intoxicated ;)
