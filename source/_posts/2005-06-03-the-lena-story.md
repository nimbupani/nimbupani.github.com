I came across <a href="http://lenna.org">Lena</a> when I did Image Processing and Neural Networks in NTU. A very intelligent friend of mine knew the source of the photograph and told me that it was the photograph from playboy. 

I was hooked. I mean, when was the last time science and playboy came together? I was very curious to know the full story. Now, <a href="htp://lenna.org">Lenna.org</a> has the full story and a link to the original picture (the picture contains nudity). 

And what's more, she is alive and the old sexy looks are gone and in place is a glow and beauty that grows with age! Welcome back Lena!

P.S. There is an internet censor body in Singapore! I wasnt allowed access to one of the links in the <a href="http://lenna.org">lenna.org</a> pages. Gives me this:

<blockquote> Due to Media Development Authority (MDA) regulation, this website that you are trying to access is a restricted website.</blockquote>
