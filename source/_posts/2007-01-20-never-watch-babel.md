<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449467/">Babel</a> is one movie that anyone with as much patience as a woman in labour <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449467/">should never watch</a>. In fact, you shouldnt even try to see the posters, or get tempted by the "beautiful cinematography", and other such comments that friends might make to entice you to watch. 

I unfortunately did. 

I found the story line naive, the fractured sadness of every cast member including the poor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester_rifle">Winchester Rifle</a> unbearable, and the mere presence of Brad Pitt intolerable. Sigh...if only there was a flickr set of the images in the movie, my 2 hours and extra minutes would have been better spent looking at them rather than watching the movie. 

I am still reeling from the effects of this movie. I have warned you.
