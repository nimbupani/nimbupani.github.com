<p>I found myself book-less on an MRT ride and looked around for something to do. I chanced upon the 10% Power Savings Campaign one of which claims:</p>
<blockquote>Standb power can add upto 10% of your bill. Switch off appliances at the power socket to save about $50* a year!
<small>* based on electricity tariff of $0.2388 per unit KWh, assuming 35W of standby power in a given home.</small></blockquote>
<p>Now, it stands to reason that 10% of my monthly bill equals about $4 of power savings ($50/12) per month. Does that mean my monthly bill is only $40?</p>
<p>In an other advertisement in the same train, they claim 10% of your monthly bill can be saved by setting the temperature on the air-con 2 degrees higher than usual which comes to $50 <em>per month</em>. So now, my monthly bill equals $500!</p>
<p>I like maths, and am annoyed when people disregard maths just for the sake of a "10%" campaign. Would be a lot more effective if you give me the <em>real</em> statistics, instead of a fake 10% number.</p>
