I have never seriously considered my ability to draw. I mean really, I never learnt drawing. I have been scribbling ever since I was born. The walls of my house were adorned with my graffiti till my parents found out I had overgrown my habit of scribbling on the walls. But I do thank them for actually letting me scribble with my maroon crayons (I still remember the graffiti!). My mom and dad tried to put me in some drawing class and make me learn drawing. But I stubbornly refused, preferring to doodle on my own. There is still one notebook dating back to 1984 with my doodles of humans (or so I think) , alphabets (very obviously, I didnt know how to write alphabets, but copied what ever I saw) and lots of eggs. 

Anyways, the point being, I started drawing and painting seriously, only after I came to the University and only during my vacations.  And I was discovering the different materials (watercolor, pastels, poster colors) then. I chanced upon a postcard advertising the National Geographic Channel with these two girls. And I was struck by the colors of the photograph and I thought I might as well give it a try using water colours and try to actually "paint" for the first time (I always sketch or use pastels or "sketch pens"!). Anyways, here is the result of my first experiment with painting.
