I went to <a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg/">the Arts House</a> today with the sole intention of getting to see obscure Polish Posters with Oriental twist. I mistakenly went to the second floor and to my great surprise and pleasure, ran into a gallery of <a href="http://theory.tifr.res.in/bombay/leisure/art/mf-hussain.html">M F Husain</a>'s latest works! My heart lept and cries of joy were obscuring my vision -  my dream fulfilled! 

The beauty of art is what you dont draw. For example, appreciate the beauty of <a href="http://www.zeigermann.com/cartoonist/categories/paintingsByWolf/2005/10/04.html#a4329">this sketch of Gunter Grass</a> and what speaks loudest are the lines that you imagine and interpret to exist while you wonder at the beauty of these lines that you created out of the empty space provided by the artist. 

Husain is on that level. He is my God of Arts next to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> and I almost was too excited to even notice the painting when I went around the gallery for the first time! 

This collection is titled 'The Lost Continent' and has consistency in colors and themes. Hussain uses shiny and rough colors creating vivid attractive effects that play with the lights of the environment. 

And for those who wish to catch his paintings rush now to the Arts House second floor as the exhibition closes tomorrow at 8.00 p.m.!
