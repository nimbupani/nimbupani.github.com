<p>This year started pretty well for my reading schedule. I managed to finish two huge books in January, but am on a particularly slow pace since. It also doesn't help that I am in Oslo for the first two weeks of Feb getting to know people in Opera as part of my <a href="http://nimbupani.com/web-opener-at-opera.html">new position</a>. So these are all I am left with: </p>

<H3>The Jewel in the Crown</H3>
<p>I was recommended to read this by <a href="http://coldhead.miketaylr.com">Coldhead</a> (warning loud music and visuals). I am usually not a fan of colonialist literature, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226743403?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0226743403">The Jewel in the Crown</a> breaks new ground. There are characters of different hues, and the experiences are described vividly, while not portraying a flattering picture of the British Raj. It is very well written and a book (for being so wordy) requires as much to describe the story. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in that series.</p>

<h3>Gould's Book of Fish</h3>
<p>When I was embarking on my first trip to Australia, good old Coldhead, recommended I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802139590?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802139590">Gould's Book of Fish</a> in addition to <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-september.html">Voss</a>. I never got around it, but I finally did! It is incredible (except for the ending). I really cannot describe how amazing it is. I only beg you to read it.</p>

<h3>Tokyo Vice</h3>
<p>This is a horribly written book by someone who was one of the very few white reporters for a Japanese newspaper who worked on the Tokyo police beat. There is an incredible amount of information on how Tokyo's police/press work, but it is all suppressed by bad writing. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307378799?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307378799">Tokyo Vice: An American Reporter on the Police Beat in Japan</a> is definitely not worth your time unless you have a passing interest in Tokyo Crime scenes.</p>

<h3>Ender's Game</h3>
<p>When I finished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765342294?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0765342294">Ender's Game</a> I thought it was a plot for a bad science fiction movie, but then I realised it was written more than 30 years ago! It is quite a remarkable modern take on alien invasion with more than a thinly veiled support for wars and war games. I suppose the supporters of the book would claim the ending justifies the pacifist motives of the author, but I think it doesn't. It is a nice read to escape the tortures of flying, but I don't think it does anything more than be a precursor to game strategies outlined in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar's_Poker">Liar's Poker</a>.</p> 

<p>As usual, here is my plea for you to recommend books you liked reading this month!</p>
