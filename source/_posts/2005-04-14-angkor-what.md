Will be visiting <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Angkor_Archaeological_Park">Angkor Wat</a> this year. Any tips and tricks? 

Looking up the prices of the tickets, I realised it was as expensive as those to India. According to economics when the demand is down the prices should reduce too. 

But then, Cambodia is a place that you dont visit unless you are forced to (or in the case of tourists a compelling reason beyond any fickle tourism makes you visit the country), which is why the ticket prices are really high. As those who go there do not have two minds about going there. It really is a "necessity", hence more expensive. Apparently there are landmines strewn all over the place!
