...one year away from home does things to you.

For starters, your nose gets blocked as soon as you set foot on the soil.

Mosquitoes from all over the world arrive to attack you on your open pores creating convex craters all over the visible surface. There goes your plan to wear something "minimal" to beat the heat. 

You detest dirt. Dirt sickens you, disgusts you. You spend hours cleaning the house, imagining yourself as the Pasteur of this century, emptying bottles of Dettol and Savlon into every possible crevice. Of course, dust and dirt promptly return within a few seconds of doing so.

The house looks smaller than before or perhaps I am "fatter" than before?

Anyways, this trip has awakened the cricket fan in me which had been dormant since the first match fixing rumour. Virender Sehwag rocks!
