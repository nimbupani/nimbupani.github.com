<p>My activities as a web designer were becoming more prominent and my personal site did not express that sufficiently. Hence, I created <a href="http://nimbu.in">nimbu.in</a> (and I tweet about Web Design at <a href="http://twitter.com/nimbuin">http://twitter.com/nimbuin</a>).</p> 
<p>While this site is, ahem, very colourful, it does not have a unique brand (other than the effusive colours). So, I set about creating a memorable but offbeat logo. I love the designs from the late 20s-30s and I found a perfect poster from my scrapbook to base my color scheme on (#1):</p>
<p><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2463/3898682838_4de39ba0f0_o.png" alt="Inspirations for the design of nimbu.in" /> </p>
<p>I used the other two pictures to guide the aged and comics-like look of the logo. The text on the logo is customized from different serif fonts I found on early 20th century posters.</p>

<p>Then, I wrote, and wrote, and wrote. I didn&rsquo;t realise writing about myself would be such a difficult task. After about 3 re-writes, I arrived at the current text.</p>
<p>Two days ago, I started creating the website. <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak Jois</a> was consistently prodding me to design for <a href="http://24ways.org/2006/compose-to-a-vertical-rhythm">vertical rhythm</a> (he also asked me to &ldquo;fix&rdquo; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widows_and_orphans">widows</a> on the text, I refused &mdash; Web is not print).</p>
<p>This is my process to create a vertical rhythm in web pages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Install and enable <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7943">Pixel Perfect</a> extension for Firefox Firebug.</li>                     
	<li><a href="http://netprotozo.com/grid/">Generate the grid</a> and download the grid as an image.</li>
	<li>Click on the Pixel Perfect tab on Firebug and overlay this image on the HTML page. You can position it exactly and also control the opacity.</li>
	<li>Once positioned, use <a href="http://getfirebug.com/css.html">firebug to manipulate the CSS</a> so that the text lines up vertically against the grid.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This site is the beginning of the <a href="http://html5doctor.com/designing-a-blog-with-html5/">switch to HTML 5 </a>on my personal sites.
