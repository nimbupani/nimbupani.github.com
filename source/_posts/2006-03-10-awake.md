My unfulfilled wish finally came true today when I woke up fresh, as if I had never slept, at 5.00 a.m. Unbelievable, but true. Even before the nasty alarm clock. And I blame it on an update to the human matrix that the machines are doing. 

On a separate note, some movies I want to watch:
1. <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/04/2404/summary.php">X Men The Last Stand</a>
2. <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/62/2462/summary.php">Scanner Darkly</a>
3. <a href="http://www.movieweb.com/movies/film/51/2851/summary.php">V for Vendatta</a>
