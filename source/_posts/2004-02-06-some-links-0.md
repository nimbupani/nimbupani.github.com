Aggregators are awesome. I think aggregatorss have potential to aggregate 'anything', if you get the picture. Anyways, here are some cool links through my aggregator:
<ul><li>Ever drawn as a kid with felt pens? I didn't have those pens, only the inky ball point pens.But <a href="http://www.nuisance.org.uk/html/stole_felt.html">this</a> guy has transfomred his childhood drawings into something bwautiful and really lively.</li>
<li>DIdn't understand what the Japanese were speaking in <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0335266/">Lost in Translation</a>?<a href="http://cgi.monjunet.ne.jp/PT/honyaku/bin/hksrch.dll?Q=motoko+rich&D=149296&I=2"> Here</a> is your translator</li>
<li>There WAS something as bad as the <a href="http://www.iath.virginia.edu/osheim/intro.html">plague epidemic</a> in Europe.. it was the flu. Spies are reporting that scientists have <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3455873.stm">found out</a> how the deadly flu spread so rapidly, killing hundreds of people.
