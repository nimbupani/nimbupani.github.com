If <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368891/">National Treasure</a> has any claim to fame, it would be for being the most blatant ad of Aquafina and Visa. Of course, it will also beat any Famous Five plot hands down for being one of the most pathetic plots in the history of movies.  And dont get me started on Nicholas Cage. Mel Gibson wisely took to direction and so did Arnold. Time's up for Nicholas Cage and I hope this movie makes him realise that!

Oh, one more thing, did anyone notice the scary person playing Nicholas's father? He looked like Kamal Hasan (the old man) in Indian!
