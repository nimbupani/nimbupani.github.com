While on my jaunt to the <a href="http://sg.ksdb.com/768039.page">lunch hour hogging center</a>, I came across this spanking building that houses these two singapore biggies: <a href="http://www.aviva.com/">Aviva</a> and <a href="http://www.nkfs.org/">NKF</a>. And I also spotted the following on the building:

...Officially opened by: 

MRS. GOH CHOK TONG...

I was flabbergasted. Here I am, in a country of equal opportunities, a "developed" country, a country that is flush with money and soon to be rich in casino cash, and they could only label the person who presided over the opening ceremony as a "Mrs. Goh Chok Tong"? Doesnt she have a name? And if they do not find her "worthy" in her own right, why invite her in the first place? 

And it is very curious why would anyone consent to open a building that doesnt even respect the individual doing the ceremony but rather prizes her relationship with the ex-Prime Minister (as a wife). And all this in a country where "meritocracy" is prized the most. 

And very curiously, all google results have "Mrs. Goh Chok Tong" rather than her name! And it <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&biw=1280&q=%22mrs.+lee+hsien+loong%22&btnG=Search">seems</a> to be a <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&biw=1280&q=%22mrs.+lee+kuan+yew%22&btnG=Search">tradition</a> to refer to all women married to celebrities to be referred this way! How come the men who get married to celebrities do not get this "privilege"? Can we have <a href="http://www.zoetay.org/bio.htm">Mr. Zoe Tay</a> standing up please?
