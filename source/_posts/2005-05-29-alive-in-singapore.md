Almost two weeks flew past me in a flash and it felt like i lived more than two months within those weeks! 

I cant wait to begin on my trip to mumbai and chennai, the bloggers meet, my mom's first mac, my first conversation with my cousins, my shopping trips and my experience of globalization -"subway" style. I will unravel in the next few weeks. 

Meanwhile, there is a <a href="http://sambharmafia.blogspot.com/2005/05/singapore-bloggers-meet-5th-june.html">Singapore Indian Bloggers Meet</a>. Do drop by.
