Ok, as you would have noticed, I have redesigned my blog (duh!). A few pointers:

<ol>
<li> This site looks most pretty in <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a>. </li>
<li> Mozilla has been created with the sole purpose of distorting my newly pretty blog.</li>
<li> IE sucks as it puts borders around my images without asking me, so I needed to explicitly specify "no borders!"</li>
<li> All the free tags (h1,h2..) come with strings attached, so extra time spent in removing the unwanted weeds.</li>
<li> Do not attempt to read through my style sheet coz it sucks.</li>
<li>You get to take a free peek at the thumbnails of photos which I will put up on my future plog (photoblog for the uninitiated).</li>
</ol>
