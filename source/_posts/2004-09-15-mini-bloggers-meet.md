Met up with <a href="http://ravikumar.blogdrive.com/">Ravi</a>, a blogger I first met at the previous <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2004/06/03/drumrolls.php">Blogger's meet</a> I attended in Chennai. Had a wonderful time discussing stuff about Singapore and India. Very glad to know somebody who takes time to appreciate art! Thanks a lot for your company Ravi! Will meet ya when I come to Madras next time! Too bad the pics are in his camera! Well have to wait for his post :)
