Went to this exhibition <a href="http://theartshouse.com.sg/event_details.php?id=201">Jafri Meets Warhol</a> at <a href="http://theartshouse.com.sg/history.html">The Arts House</a>. Amazing stuff. 

Warhol, as usual was mind blowing. Simple but earth shaking stuff. There were the typical Warhols <a href="http://webexhibits.org/colorart/marilyns.html">Marlyin</a>, <a href="http://www.warholprints.com/portfolio/Mao.html">Mao</a> and the <a href="http://www.globalgallery.com/enlarge/022-31170/">Campbell Soup</a>. The most striking was the Marlyin I had never seen, the black and grey version. Amazing elegance. Totally transformed from the retro we have seen in the others. 

Not sure in what way <a href="http://www.bailliegallery.com/art/art_11.htm">Jafri paintings</a> are similar to Warhol. He is more<a href="http://www.artcyclopedia.com/scripts/r.pl?Q126+295"> Van Gogh</a> inspired. Lovely spashes of color and an amazing painting of a boxing ring with boxers in action in the lovely Van Gogh shades of violet (reminds me of "<a href="http://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/p_0612.htm">Starry Night</a>" by VG). 

Jafri brings out the emotions like Vincent. Slightest of the line curves can make so much difference! His paintings are insightful and make you think or atleast you fall into a trance staring at them! 

Funnily, he was there fuddling around with the lights. Wanted to tell him how amazing it was to find somebody painting like Van Goh and not imitating VG. But words failed me. Sigh...
