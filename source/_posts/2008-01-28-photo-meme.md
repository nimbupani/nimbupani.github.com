<a href="http://www.selectiveamnesia.org/2008/01/05/this-meme-is-so-last-year/">SelAm</a> has asked me to participate in a meme. It has been a while since I participated in memes, so here it goes:
<h3>Rules</h3>
All you have to do is select and upload one photo that you have clicked this year that is special to you. Could be anythingâ€¦aesthetic, technical or personal. Also, put in a short note why it is special.

Here is mine:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/1392438660/" title="Lonely by nimbu, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1351/1392438660_ecef3adc3f.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Lonely" /></a>

This was taken somewhere in South Canera. I loved every aspect of the trip. The landscapes were out of the world and the places so remote. It was also where I tasted my first <em>Neer Dosai</em>. 

I love this photo's composition (even though it was a fluke!). A lonely electric pole in the sea of greenery in the early morning mist, reminds of the beautiful place instantly.

By the time this post goes up, the world must have heard of this meme, so the buck stops here.
