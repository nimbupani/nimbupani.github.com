80s is an age that cant be classified. The early 80s enjoyed the 70s hangover with a resurgence of the 60s style, which later morphed into the disastrous and much hated 80s look (one look at <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093578/">Mr. India</a> and you know what I am talking about). Karz, thankfully, is the child of the early 80s and established Subhash Ghai in the league of Nassir Hussain (when it comes to style). 

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214841/">Karz</a> has everything going for a successful movie, it was a first in the film industry for innovative titles (the titles are props for the first song) and had catchy numbers extravagantly choreographed on the nimble footed Rishi Kapoor. 

In the early 80s, the 70s shoulder button fashion are replaced with chest pocket fashion (bold strokes near the chest area), while the style still was stuck at tight shirts and bell bottoms, The afro look was in too -you can see men tottering around with thick curly hair in the movie. Glitz came back with a vengance and made it imperative that everything from top to toe glitter (which became worse in the late 80s). Karz has glittering balls and completely silver/gold costumes for Rishi Kapoor.  The female dressing still reflected the 70s a little, but took a turn for worse with tiny jackets over the blouses and tight fit near the hip (like the 60s) and skirts that reach just beyond the knee. 

The style elements of the disaster that was 80s are evident in the movie. Simi Garewal wears a horrible red costume (hat, jacket and pants). 

Karz is the kitsch mix that is unforgettable and grips you with the storyline however improbable! Karz embodies the best style of the 80s and glitters among the style disaster that was the 80s.
