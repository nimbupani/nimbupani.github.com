I am on the verge of impatience and implosion as I try and 'interpret' the laws and case laws for tomorrow's exam on law (one of my core subjects). But <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16736">this</a> ( via <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/">LawMeme</a> ) really blew me away ( no pun intended ;) ). 


Apparently, the Wright Brothers caused more harm than good by the way of their patents. Quite interesting read, especially the little parable in the beginning. Ah, intellectual properties are finally beginning to make sense!
