If you see my <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/project.html">projects</a> link, it would seem like there is nothing good to write home about. But <acronym title="my">this</acronym> pea-sized brain can only comprehend projects that are written purely in English. I have four project submissions (the other two projects are in Cryptography and Computer Architecture).Though the deadlines are nearing, my projects are still happy to dawdle at the starting point! :(

And to think I need to get started on my resume too! Deadlines, deadlines, deadlines. Bah! A very bad week ahead.
