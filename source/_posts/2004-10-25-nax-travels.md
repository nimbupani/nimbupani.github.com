If you ever wish to find courteous, prompt, helpful and efficient customer service in India.. you will almost never find one with all the qualities. But, sometimes, you tend to get lucky (you need to get lucky atleast ONCE in your life!) and you get to work with a travel agency that has all these and more. No, the agency has paid NO MONEY (rather I am paying to get my mom's ticket and visa!) and I have no selfish interest apart from advertising the goodness of the travel agency which is guaranteed to remove one or two of those wrinkly lines on your head and put a smile on your face and even possibly make you happy about the fact that you live in the smoky, dusty Chennai. 

Now that you know the power of the agency note down the link: <a href="http://www.naxtravels.com">Nax Travels</a>. My parents found out about them and they were the main points of contact for the agency. But the agency was courteous enough to keep me informed of  the developments. More than that, when the phone in my house in Chennai went out of service, they even mailed me the information and were even ready to pass on any information to my parents (as my parents use dial up and a dead phone=no contact)! Now <i>that</i> is customer service. 

Today I got a mail saying all visa and ticket procedures have been completed and enquiring whether I was satisfied with the service! Woohoo! I am MORE than satisfied! So, if you need to ever book your tickets without a hassle from Chennai, bookmark the website!
