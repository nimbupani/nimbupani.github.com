I have loved and enjoyed the absurdity and insight of Douglas Adam’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy since I read the series earlier this year. But <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345391802?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0345391802">the covers for the books does not convey that at all</a>! Even <a href="http://www.traileraddict.com/trailer/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy/trailer-b">the movie trailer does a better job of presenting that</a> (with Stephen Fry!) So, here are my versions of each cover. Fans will know what each book cover stands for. If you don’t know, ask away in the comments!
