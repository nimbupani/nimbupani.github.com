Oh well, this is another nostalgia article. About the different 'charts' I used to make in school. Our school has student-eating bugs masquerading as 'Science' teachers and deciding to pump up their achievements in terms of the number of 'charts' they ask their students to make. So, in a yearly ritual that we would end up making atleast ten 'charts' to cover up the walls of our big classroom. (A class without atleast one 'Timetable' chart was smirked upon). In those golden days, 'printers' and 'computers' existed only in the realms of the sci-fi books. So, for resources, we needed to look for some hard copy 'clip art' collections. 

The traditional hand-me-downs had always included the name of the shops which had 'attractive' posters for making those charts at a cheap price of course. And these served as our clip art. These 'attractive' posters, to my amusement, have found a place<a href="http://www.retrocrush.com/archive2003/charts/"> here!</a>
