<ul><li>My first tryst with a circuit board was when I did the project using 68k microprocessor. Was quite impressed with the tiny chips and connectors on the board. Looked artistic... Apparently, it IS art too, going by the <a href="http://smithsonianchips.si.edu/chipfun/graff.htm">"signatures"</a> of IC designers on these things. </li>

<li>I just saw "Fantasia 2000" and realised it contains a cartoon that is a <a href="http://www.awn.com/mag/issue4.09/4.09pages/solomonrhapsody.php3">tribute</a> to this <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2004/03/15/al_hirchfield.php">awesome artist</a>. It is the finest piece of animation evoking the "roaring 30s".  Just listen to  George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" , if you wish to be transported to those "good old days" of New York.  The only animation that ever comes close to this would be the <a href="http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/03/26/retro_titles.html">retro titles</a> of "Catch Me If You Can" :)  </li></ul>
