The Wachowski brothers seem to hav a mismash of path breaking ideas which never are explored. Uncle KFC makes an entry in the end, mercifully, this time in a grey suit.

I really liked the idea of programs having humane feelings. Its quite possible and revolutionary. Humans are evolutions of neurons, programs can be revolutions of virtual neural networks or artificial intelligence. Or for that matter any complex program can and might actually start thinking itself!  Ah, now I know why I fear Neural Networks! The words that the program utters seem straight out of a Philosophy Made Simple Course. And the programs were Indian to the boot! I guess, the fact that majority of programmers are Indians, the programs were also represented by Indians! 

Yeah, I like the Opera ( I meant the western classical music opera NOT our favourite browser) version of <i>Asathoma Sadhgamaya...</i>. Quite a good fusion especially with the background of hindustani music with the drums. 

But all said and done, there is very little new in this movie, just like the previous one. If only the Brothers could steer clear of making movies that appeal to the masses, but indulge in more philosophical explorations of the virtual world, Matrix would become a philosophy of every thinking man (Move over Ayn Rand :) ). 

Watching the movie in an <a href="http://imax.com">IMAX</a> theatre makes the movie a full <i>paisa-vasool</i>  ("good profit for money spent", Hindi illiterates).
