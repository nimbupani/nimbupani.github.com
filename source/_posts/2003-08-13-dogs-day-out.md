<a href=http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/CPicZ.aspx?E=I_2S5RYD1MUSQG&o=THT">This</a> is a picture from a photobook. For some weird reason I cant link to the whole photobook as such. If you are interested, go to <a href="http://www.magnumphotos.com/c/htm/TreePfTop.aspx?E=A_29YL53DLU3P&V=Photographers"> Magnum</a> and look for the book  "Dog Dog" under the photographer called <B>Erwitt Elliot</B>. 

Its a tribute to dogs in all their forms.  The first expression that comes to your mind will be "oh! so cuuute!".

Well, really what is a man without a dog? Either its your best friend  or your worst enemy. I have never come across the first case, but have many experiences of the second.

All dogs I come across regard me as one mortal enemy that they should never leave out of their ferocious sight. It still rankles me, when I think of thew day I came thhhhhhhhhhhhhiiiiis close  to being bitten by a ferocious dog. Ever since, I have kept my distance from these enemies.

Some day, I would like it if the dogs let me pet them. Sigh, I think the day will never come .
