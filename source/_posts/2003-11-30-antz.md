When I am really really bored or too lazy, I try and analyse ants' behaviour (no kidding). I discovered that once I rub the path between two ants, the rest of the entourage are as lost as <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0325980/">Jack Sparrow</a> on the lonely island . I pondered on the possibility of performing surgery on an ant. I mean, like fix its leg or worse, mend its eyes. I  performed some of my own with the help of a safety pin on dead ants (killed painlessly with one stroke of my podgy thumb). 

No doubt such noble intentions and explorations, if continued further, would contribute to the greater cause of preventing and curing ants of several diseases. <a href="http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0000037">Here</a> is how I would have profitably used my experiences if I were a biologist. 

<b>P.S.</b> If you are still wondering why ants "lose sense of direction" read the article for more information. Its pheromones silly!
