In my first year, I had several brushes with Christianity (I am a hindu). I mean, different types of the religion. Some student or the other from Protestant/Catholic/ others club would knock on my door, give me a fish ball ( I am a vegetarian) and would ask me personal details (which religion you follow? do you know about jesus christ? do you know about his wonders? would you want to become christian?). I hardly had time to say "no", before which they would start requesting to "pray" for me. And, before I could refuse, they would already be deep in prayer. 


I am not against Christianity. I am fine with people following whatever religion they want.  But I don't like this pushy business of conversion especially in Universities. But <a href="http://www.harpers.org/JesusPlusNothing.html">this</a> article takes the cake:


<I>"Regular prayer groups have met in the Pentagon and at the Department of Defense, and the Family has traditionally fostered strong ties with businessmen in the oil and aerospace industries....In the process of introducing powerful men to Jesus, the Family has managed to effect a number of behind-the-scenes acts of diplomacy... The Brazilian dictator General Costa e Silva, with Family support, was overseeing regular fellowship groups for Latin American leaders, while, in Indonesia, General Suharto (whose tally of several hundred thousand ?Communists? killed marks him as one of the century's most murderous dictators) was presiding over a group of fifty Indonesian legislators"</I>

Lieutenant-General William G Boykin's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3199212.stm">speech</a> makes the article more credible.
