<p>This week I heard about the death of a close family friend. He was my only connection to my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/sets/72057594080142412/">grandfather</a> who knew most details of my grandpa&rsquo;s extraordinary life. But what struck me more was my indifferent reaction to the news. This Illustration Friday could have come at a no better moment. I feel a sense of loss, of myself and of the friend. Rest in peace, Balu mama. </p>
