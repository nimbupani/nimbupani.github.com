<p>Seems like the holiday season is a good time to read more books! So, here are 8 more books reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<h3>American Born Chinese</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312384483?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0312384483">American Born Chinese</a> is a book by a second-generation Chinese on how he overcomes the Chinese Stereotype, which is told within the tale of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Wukong">Monkey King</a>. I find the &ldquo;moral&rdquo; a bit contradictory and confusing (Monkey King is told there is no place for him among the &ldquo;Gods&rdquo;.) At least it brings racism to the front without accusing or wronging another race.</p></li> 
<li><h3>The Best of Simon and Kirby</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1845769317?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1845769317">The Best of Simon and Kirby</a> is a gorgeous book of full-page illustrations by Jack Kirby. Enough said.
</p></li>

<li><h3>Aya</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1894937902?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1894937902">Aya</a> is one of the rare graphic novels about Ivory Coast which does not talk about poverty or civil war but is a humourous look at the world of young people. I am definitely reading the whole series.</p></li>

	<h3>The Girl Who Played with Fire</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307269981?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307269981">The Girl Who Played with Fire</a> is the next in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Trilogy" title="Millennium Trilogy - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Millennium trilogy</a> by Steig Larsson. As usual it is dark and thrilling. I have never been taken up by a thriller like the ones written by him. It rankles me that we will see no more from Steig.</p></li> 

<li><h3>Fatherland</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812977211?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0812977211">Fatherland: A Novel</a> is a fantasy novel set in the alternate world where Hitler won the war. But the plot of the book is rather trivial and did not need an &ldquo;alternate world&rdquo; at all. It was a good read, but not quite what I expected.</p></li> 

<li><h3>By Design</h3><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563673495?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1563673495">By Design: Why There Are No Locks on the Bathroom Doors in the Hotel Louis XIV and Other Object Lessons</a> is a great series of essays on Design. It has such gems like &ldquo;Making it nice is not making it right&rdquo;, &ldquo;I know when taste improves, it becomes closer to what I like&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Take pleasure seriously&rdquo;. It also explains how the occupation of a &ldquo;Designer&rdquo; came into existence and what separates design from art or engineering. Must read for anyone interested in design.</p></li>


<li><h3>The Adventures of Herge</h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0867196793?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0867196793">The Adventures of Herge: Creator of Tintin</a> is a fanboy biography of Herg&eacute;. It has some lovely pictures and explains how Herge created different adventures of Tintin. It also states Herg&eacute; liked the idea of Steven Spielberg creating a movie on Tintin and I am glad that it is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0983193/" title="The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn (2011)">finally happening</a>. It is also funny to see the real-life photos of different characters of Tintin (Dr. Muller, Thomson &amp; Thompson, Tintin, Sponz, Chang) and note how strikingly alike they are!</li>

	<h3>The New Kings of Nonfiction</h3><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594482675?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594482675">The New Kings of Nonfiction</a> is a compendium of articles from the 80s to early 00s. The one that struck me most was that of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/w/weschler-city.html">Akumal Ramachander</a> (mainly because I am, in some ways, similar to him) and a <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200504/wallace">story on a right-wing radio show host</a> by David Foster Wallace.</li>
