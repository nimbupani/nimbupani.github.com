Blogs may not be mainstream in India yet. But <a href="http://www.mtvindia.com">MTV India</a> has picked this up as a definite cool thing to do. There is a <a href="http://www.mtvindia.com/mtv/mymtv/shows/roadies2/blog.php">blog</a> describing the events in the selection roadshow for the few who will become the MTV Roadies 2. This is a program where some normal "youths" will be filmed riding all over India on bikes and apparently doing some cool things. The blog doesnt look that great, but then the recognition of a "cool factor" in blogging by MTV is interesting. Perhaps it <i>is</i> "hep" to blog? ;)
