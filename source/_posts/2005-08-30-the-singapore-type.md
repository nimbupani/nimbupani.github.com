I have created a new group on flickr called the <a href="http://flickr.com/groups/stype/">Singapore Type</a> to celebrate the diversity in Singaporean typeface industry. 

This flickr pool is a documentation of the historical highs and lows od the typefaces in Singapore and through that also tracks the most popular typefaces today. There are typical designs and typefaces which are solely used for one purpose only ( for e.g. food stall menu typefaces). 

I request the armchair graphic designers of Singapore to get up and get shooting! Contribute to the encyclopedia of type design and win the blessings of countless of designers worldwide! =D

P.S. All this is made possible by the new Digital IXUS 50 =D.
