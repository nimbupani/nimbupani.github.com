title: Ministry of Education gets a slick new website

<a href="http://www.moe.edu.sg">Ministry of Education, Singapore (MOE) has got a slick new look</a> - and proved that government websites and aesthetic usable designs, CAN go hand in hand. MoE's redesign now reminds me of how a government service should be: "Integrity. Service. Excellence." (Singapore Government's slogan). To know how bad (or good) a government website can be, lets compare it with the <a href="http://www.mica.gov.sg/">website of the Ministry of Information, Communication &amp; the Arts (MICA)</a>

Here is how they both look "above the fold":

Clearly, the use of subtle cues in the <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr>'s redesign draws the user to the central changing content about what is the latest news in MOE. Other subtle use of colors enable the user to find links when required. 

<abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr> also uses microformats for the organizational structure which is quite neat. I think MOE website must be the first government website to validate <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=www.moe.edu.sg&charset=%28detect+automatically%29&doctype=Inline&group=0">XHTML 1.0 Strict</a> and <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=www.moe.edu.sg&profile=css21&usermedium=all&warning=1&lang=en">CSS</a>. Did I mention it is eminently accessible without any spacer.gifs?

A look at the footers of <abbr title="Ministry of Information, Communication &amp; the Arts">MICA</abbr> and <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr> reveal that due thinking has gone into that as well in the <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr> website:

However, there are a few things I would like in the new website:
<ol>
	<li>
		It is not clear which category or type the current page belongs to. Perhaps the menu item can be highlighted if it any of its child links are clicked.
	</li>
	<li>
		Breadcrumbs seem to be text only. It would be great if they are links too. 
	</li>
</ol>

I think it is best that it is not incorporating the traditional system of a simple "poll" (found in all Singapore government websites) which is not enough to measure the quality of any website. 

Overall, I think it is a great step forward for Singapore government websites. Of course, I think some small changes might be needed from the perspective of usability but that is just to make the already enhanced experience even better! Way to go <abbr title="Ministry of Education, Singapore">MOE</abbr>!
