Our University library is really huge, resembling more of a cyber cafe than a library. Of course, all the computers in there run WinXP, which makes life a little easier. I will tell you why.

There is something called a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/WINDOWSXP/pro/using/howto/gomobile/remotedesktop/default.asp">Remote Desktop</a> ( You must enable it on your desktop first). You can then access this desktop from anywhere in the world (literally!). I know I can access the drives on my desktop in the room from the terminal using this feature. But the best part is when the reverse happens. My room computer (if accessed through the library terminal) can directly connect to the library's printers.Now, I can directly print stuff to the library printer without having the hassle of copying the stuff into a public directory and copying them again into the library computer drive.
