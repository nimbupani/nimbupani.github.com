<a href="http://blog.deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> wrote a very objective post on the racial profiling in <a href="http://blog.deepak.jois.name/2007/05/racial-profiling-in-singapore-rental.html">Singapore real estate rental market</a> - which I wouldn't have been capable of - given the number of questions that owners asked about whether we were "free thinkers" and what kind of jobs we do, what kind of education we have, etc.   It was eerie to go through the process and Deepak himself experienced being cut off on the phone by some real estate agent once he told him he was Indian :) 

Given that such events never happen otherwise in Singapore, it did seem jarring to note its increasing occurrence now in the rental market than before.
