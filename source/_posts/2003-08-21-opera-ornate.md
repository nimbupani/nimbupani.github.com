I was researching for my Final Year Project, when it struck me how useful <a href="http://www.opera.com">Opera</a> web browser is. Then I decided to pay tribute to this wonderful utility which is still free!!! :)

Well, of course I can hear you all go ' Not Again!' but still, really, isnt it great that a 'g Rastapopoulos' on the address bar does the excellent task of cutting through the formality of going to Google and THEN typing all this!( Sheer waste of time!)

(P.S. Those who dont know Rastapopoulos need to put their heads down in shame. Its the <a href="http://paul.durdin.net/tintin/baddies.php">Baddie</a> of <a href="http://www.tintin.com">Tintin</a> and if you havent read tintin, you are missing something really big in life.)
