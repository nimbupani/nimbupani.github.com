Deepak pointed out the recent discussions on <a href="http://www.radwin.org/michael/blog/2004/02/an_ode_to_tastybite_indian.html"> Michael J. Radwin's blog</a>  and on  <a href="http://jeremy.zawodny.com/blog/archives/001673.html">Jeremy Zawodny's blog</a> about our much beloved <a href="http://www.tastybite.com/">Tasty Bite</a>. Any Indian student in Singapore has a ready stock of Tasty Bites to pull through during exams and other Bad Days. 

Tasty Bite is common in India too. Apparently the typical heckled working mother finds it easier to store tasty bites and make instant food for her kids (that's what my mom thinks).  But the most surprising part of the story is , they hardly advertise! I have never seen their ads on T.V. nor have i seen ads online.. or in newspapers.. nopes.. no ads.. but still extremely successful. I think their success should be a case study for Marketing 101 :P
