When I heard about people taken at floods in Mumbai, I dismissed them as Typical Indian Monsoon News. Then, when I stumbled upon <a href="http://indiauncut.blogspot.com/">Amit Verma's blog</a>, I got to see the full force of nature's fury. 

But worse is the callousness of humanity. People dying of getting electrocuted, landslides and building collapses. Mumbai, <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2005/06/04/mumbai_musings.php">already a very dirty city</a>, is just about to get dirtier and more disease prone. Stagnant water, thanks to pathetic drainage systems, is gonna cause more disasters than the catastrophic rains.

Those who are dead will rest in peace, but it is us, who let them die of frivolous reasons, who wont. More resources are on <a href="http://cloudburstmumbai.blogspot.com/">Cloudburst Mumbai</a>.
