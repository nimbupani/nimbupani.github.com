Have you seen the new <a href="http://www.ddindia.net/RealContent/brochure/index.html">DD 'brochure'</a>'? It has details of all serials, dramas, documentaries etc, it had telecasted so far. And it is AWESOME! Imagine people like Shyam Benegal directing serials for DD! Ah, those good old days of DD! DD wasn't as bad as it is now folks! I remember watching that hilarious hindi comedy show called 'Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi'  and of course our timeless epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. 

I am not sure, but I think all channels are losing focus and going for the mad rush of TRIP ratings.  Mass producing Saans Bahu serials won't help at  generating more revenue but only wean viewers away from such cable channels. Is there anything good on Indian television nowadays? I doubt it.  Perhaps DD can start rehashing their good old collection and earn more respect from the Indian T.V. Viewer.

P.S. You shall find valuable gems in that list  including "Turning Point" .
