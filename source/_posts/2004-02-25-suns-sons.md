I was walking towards the North Indian food stall ( yeah nowadays we have food to cater to the two radically different types of Indians :)) when  I took this pic from my handphone. AH, that isn't the sun in there but one of the several street lamps that dot my university. It is totally cool when even  at three in the morning you don't have to fear the darkness as the Sun's sons are always watching us :)
