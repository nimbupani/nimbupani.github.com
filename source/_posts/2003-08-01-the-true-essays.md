 <a href="http://www.elsewhere.org/cgi-bin/postmodern">This</a>( via <a href="http://www.artnotes.org/">Artnotes</a>) is a page that has been generated by something called The PostModernism Generator. 

The essay is as good as the crap you get to read in forums of all kinds and sizes. I have noticed quite a lot of people hiding their knowledge( or their brains of hay) under the deluge of jargon, completely shocking the listener/reader. This is a crime which demands greatest attention of all legislators. It is the crime of wasting a human being's working hours leading to a vicious cycle, finally spiralling towards the economic burp. 

I am sure if the <a href="http://www.terminator3.com/">Terminator</a> takes this up as an election issue, he will breeze his way into, not only the Senate, but also the White House.
