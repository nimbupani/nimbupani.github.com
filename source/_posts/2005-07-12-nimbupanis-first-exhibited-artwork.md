<a href="http://ashwink.net/blog/">Ashwin</a> sent me a link to <a href="http://hypegallery.com.sg">Hype Gallery</a>. A click to the site left me curious and a sense of "could this be for real?". And to test it, I uploaded an image I cherish (<a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2004/10/04/about_a_boy.php">About a Boy</a>). And I get a "pending for approval" status on my uploaded image.

Three hours later, I find that my image has been approved! You can visit it virtually at <a href="http://hypegallery.com.sg">Hype Gallery website</a> and looking out for something similar to the image in the About a Boy post. 

The best part is, I could bring down the CD of my illustration which would be printed and exhibited as a part of the Hype Gallery at the Arts House! Whoopie! And I did! If you are in the periphery of The Arts House, you can see my illustration there from 10.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. Admission is FREE! I havent seen it yet (I went back after submitting the CD) and I am going there tomorrow with great trepidation! Whew! Now I know what it feels like to have your first exhibition! 

Update: As <a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> had noted, it is open from 10.30 a.m. and not 10.30 pm.!
