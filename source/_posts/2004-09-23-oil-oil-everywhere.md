<a href="http://www.emergic.org/archives/2004/09/23/index.html#oils_future_more_or_less">Rajesh Jain</a> quotes WSJ's article on Mr.Doomsday of Oil, Colin Campbell:
<blockquote>More to the point, nobody knows how much can be gotten out of the ground. Much of the oil lies in places with volatile politics, including the Middle East, Russia and Africa.</blockquote> 

<i>Very interesting</i> So the only stable oil rich country in the middle east, except Saudi Arabia was Iraq and now she also complies with the above mentioned model for Oil Rich nations! Do I smell a sinster plot? Or is it just plain greed that drives people to invoke race/religion/colour/ethnicity to create violence?
