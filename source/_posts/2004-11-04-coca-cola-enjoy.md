Precisely what the farmers in India will be screaming, if <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1341291,00.html">this news story</a> is true. Apparently Coca Cola REALLY kills pests. So instead of the National Heath Commission looking into whether Pepsi and Cola <a href="http://www.rediff.com/money/2003/aug/05pepsicoke.htm">MIX pesticides</a> into their drinks, they should reopen the case and enquire whether Coca Cola and Pepsi are pesticides themselves! 

So does this imply they kill the pests in our stomachs too? Are we looking at a miracle drink that can kill anything ranging from a pest to a man? I think we need it in these <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3980999.stm">desparate times.</a>
