Now that I am over M F Hussain's paintings, I can concentrate on reviewing the Polish Posters that were on display at <a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg">The Arts House</a> Print Gallery. 

The blurb on the flyer tells me that Polish Poster Art has been deemed a seperate stream on its own with unique characteristics. And so it proves to be. Most of the posters that were on display were made during the 80s when Poland finally had some art stuff going on. 

The sad part of the display was that all of the posters were for exhibitions of something Asian - museum exhibits, artworks, photographs, instruments, etc but not for any plays, music CDs, or movies. This was quite depressing as it seems orient did not exert any influence in polish art or posters. But nevertheless, the posters that were on display were top class! 

I LOVED The 'Lamay Graphics' of Nepal with the artwork depicting an old man who suspiciously resembled Rabindranath Tagore. Mostly, the posters were vibrant in color (save for the 'Lamay Graphics' and 'Aborigine Art' which were in black and white). There were also beautiful posters on islamic exhibitions which didnt use cliched colors or formats (green, arabic, hijab wearing women) but other beautiful motifs that were eye catching and still hit home. 

On the whole, the exhibition could have included a better variety ofposters including those that had influences of the orient but not just depicting art exhibitions, musuem exhibits on asia. But an awesome experience nonetheless! 

The exhibition is on till Oct 15 at <a href="http://www.theartshouse.com.sg">The Arts House</a> entrance aisle (apparently called the 'Print Gallery'.
