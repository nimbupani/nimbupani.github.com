After two weeks of dilly dallying, I finally managed to finish up the redesign that I have been itching to do for the past two months. The <a href="http://nimbupani.com/colophon">colophon</a> gives you an idea of the technical aspects of redesign. 

As you can see all the categories have vanished for good. They didnt make sense anyway. I am proud of the use of php and css for the active links that you see on the left, possibly I might even write down a tutorial! 

I also used <a href="http://css-discuss.incutio.com/?page=RoundedCorners">Rounded Corners</a> for the rounded rectangle you see. It isnt perfect. No solution suited my requirements well as my design does not have a plain background like the rest of the solutions. 

As of now, the site is compliant with XHTML 1.0 strict, CSS and Section 508. Hopefully, the <a href="http://www.zonageek.com/software/mt/validable/index.php">validable</a> plugin I downloaded for Movable Type will help to keep it so forever.
