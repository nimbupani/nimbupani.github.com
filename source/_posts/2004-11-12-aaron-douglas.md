A black artist who signified the emergence of "blues" in art, <a href="http://people.ku.edu/~cragar/Douglas_links.html">Aaron Douglas</a> is indeed a rare talent who does not seem to enjoy popularity unlike his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso">peers</a>. I really wonder why. The art pieces are marvellous and heavily drawn from the retro art that was sweeping America during his time.
