Bobby is a movie that captivated the masses and pushed Dimple to stardom. In fact, there is a site that is dedicated to <a href="http://www.bollywood501.com/films/bobby/">everything about Bobby</a> - including the fashion styles (which explains far better than I do!). But what I like about Bobby is the poster which is just a reflection of the psychedelic 70s. In fact, it is the only movie to have such psychedelic posters (Garam Masala tries to, but doesnt quite create this effect). 

It is obvious why the film has such posters when you watch the movie. Even though the plot is as old as Raj Kapoor, the costumes that the actors wear is as scandalous and as far from reality as it can get. In that sense, it is a radical departure from "normal movies" where the designers stick to being as less creative as possible. 

This movie introduces the <a href="http://www.bollywood501.com/films/bobby/htm/gallery4j.html">ubiquitous scarves</a> - this style didn't reach the masses till the early 80s and persisted till the 90s! It does look good with the clothes Dimple wears in the film, but when used with frumpy oversized salwaar kameezes and jeans, it looks quite disgusting! Whew, I was so glad when people started getting over this hideous design! In fact, this film introduces several design elements which were all contorted to suit the moral taste of India and became hideous in that process. 

<a href="http://www.bollywood501.com/films/bobby/htm/gallery2d.html">The polka top</a> is another. I remember wearing a similar top except it reached beyond my waist! Ugh, I get depressed every time I reflect on my dressing sense in the 90s :)

Bobby is a film you should watch for the Indian take on the psychedelic 70s look. Now you know how well the poster fits the movie!
