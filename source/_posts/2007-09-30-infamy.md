I wanted to paint something for <a href="http://inparties.net">inparty</a> that was happening on 28th Sept, but it was too late. This was/is meant to be a study that will finally go into a canvas. Obviously, it is not meant to be symmetrical as it appears here. 

It was the first time I was using acrylics - all thanks to <a href="http://mitokondrion.blogspot.com/">Mito</a> who had generously donated her acrylics, awesome paperworks (which you saw in <a href="http://nimbupani.com/2007/09/22/juggle.php">Juggle</a>), and other stuff that is inspiring me to paint more!
