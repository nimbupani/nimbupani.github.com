Just realised how I collapse the meaning of losing and failing into one. To <strong>lose</strong> is to lose a game. In Every game, There are winners and losers. Like if you didnt meet your target. Or getting a <em>No</em> from the girl you just proposed to. Thats a fact. 

<strong>Failure</strong> is something we create in our minds. Failure doesnt exist as a fact. We create the interpretation of failure to mean a lack of some talents/senses/abilities. Or having too much of it. Like bad temper. For example you can call "getting a No from the girl you proposed to" as a failure or as a fact without any meaning attached to it. When you call an incident a failure, we start attaching meanings. 

Every human being has his/her own interpretation of failure that means something personal to them like "I am not good enough". And this thwarts our actions in the future. Getting the "No" the first time, for most of us, would mean a "No" in the future. We dont even try after that. 

There are the others who do not think a "No" as a failure on their part. These are the born salesmen. They never give up. A "No" is empowering to them. Of course, they have their interpretation of failure. Like not meeting the sales targets. 

Now, everybody can become the salesmen. If only you find out why a "No" means something so personal to you. When you get to the root cause of why you think the way you think about words and what meanings you attach to them, you will give up thinking that way. Or atleast, I did =)
