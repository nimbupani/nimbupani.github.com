Was listening to the audio stream of a <a href="http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail218.html">discussion panel</a> in Gnomedex 4.0, several interesting thoughts and more importantly active audience asking relevant pointed questions. Pity there is no transcript, as, with more than seven people on the panel, it can get quite tough to find out who said what. 

Anyways here are a few interesting thoughts from that:
<ul><li>insurance for bandwidth throttle during the slashdot effect :)</li>
<strong>Podcasting:</strong>
<li>Problem: bandwidth constraint. Solution: Bittorrent?</li>
<li>inability to link to a small clip of the whole video, lack of pinging, trackback for audio posts.</li>
<strong>Ideas for blogging:</strong>
<li>amazon like pattern based search engines to rank the casts/blogs</li> 
<li>transport to any medium:TiVO, TV, Computer, iPod</li>
<li>ability to generate dynamic feeds based on patterns (using something similar to the " you might also be interested in" amazon's search engine)</li>
</ul>
