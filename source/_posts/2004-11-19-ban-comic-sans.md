Comic Sans, the font, is something I have hated ever since I had set my eyes upon it on a bleary  Windows 95 terminal in my school. But unfortunately everybody else thought otherwise and every poster that was printed through the school printer had this font plastered all over it. 

I was highly disconcerted when I found the emails exchanged between the students and profs or the secretaries to Deans and the students were written in this vile font too! I was shocked when I found even companies using this stupid font for their emails (internal/external) -whatever was on the minds of the authors? Don't they ever realise how stupid the font looks? And really, how can anybody read a serious statement ("disintermediate synergistic e-services" -from <a href="http://www.dack.com/web/bullshit.html">here</a>)  in Comic Sans? The authors might as well come to office in shorts and hawaii shirts if this is the kind of "formality" they are going to show on e-mail!
