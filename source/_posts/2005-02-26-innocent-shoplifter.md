Have you ever forgotten to pay for something you wanted to buy? I did. And funnily, nobody stopped me. While I was floating in the castles I had built on oxygen, I didnt realise that I had crossed the threshold of the shop and was now bumping my way to the MRT. 

So there I was, holding the thing I wanted to buy, but somehow managed to get away from the shop without any sales assistant stopping me. The only words I could manage were each perfect in their four letters. I couldnt think of anything else. After a few minutes of a free flow of invectives, calm thinking got the better of me and I wondered if I should let my morality take hold of me and do what is morally right or should I just walk away with my "gift"? 

The effort of taking it back and telling them what happened would have set off a catastrophic attack that would have been of historical humour value to the onlookers - an incident that needs to be passed on from one generation to the other. So I did the decent thing that every normal human being would do -walk away with it.
