I just saw a group of four people wearing white tee shirts that claims:

"1. NKF
2.HDB
3.GIC
4.CPF 

BECOME TRANSPARENT NOW!"

...they were holding transparencies that had "Accountability" and a few chinese letters on them.

They are standing outside the <a href="http://www.cpf.gov.sg">CPF building</a> in Robinson Road, even as I write. 

It will be very interesting to see what happens next.
