A lot of feathers are flying between two debaters about the existence of God. <a href="http://nandini.zblogger.com">Nan</a> and <a href="http://artanis.zblogger.com">Artanis</a> have been at <a href="http://nandini.zblogger.com/pagine/archive/id..08_03_2003_08_09_2003_archive.html">loggerheads</a> for quite sometime. Perhaps this <a href="http://www.biota.org/people/douglasadams/index.html">speech by Douglas Adams</a> should quieten things down for a while (from <a href="http://www.srijith.net/trinetre/">Srijith</a>). 

Douglas Adams is not an author I particularly like. I was planning to have a major slaughter of his "A Dark Tea Time of the Soul" in here, but I couldnt even get myself to finish the book. But his "Hitchhiker 's guide to the Galaxy" is supposed to be the best. Anyways, what he says seems be exactly my views (but layered and buttered better).
