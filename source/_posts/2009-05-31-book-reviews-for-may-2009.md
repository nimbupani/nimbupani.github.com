<p>This was a really bad month for reading books. I had barely half an hour everyday for reading books. Sigh.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<h3>Batman: The Killing Joke</h3>
		<p>I had heard a lot about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289455?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0930289455">Batman: The Killing Joke</a> and was delighted to find it in my library. It did live up to the hype. The Joker has an interesting backstory as a failed comedian. It also has an interesting perspective of the Batman and the Joker being reflections of each other (just like in Matrix of Neo and Agent Smith). A very enjoyable book!</p>

		<h3>Still I Rise</h3>
		<p>This is a comic book that details the history of blacks in United States. It was quite informative - talks about the black inventors who are usually not acknowledged in public history and the rise of the Civil rights movement. It is written and drawn by two African-Americans, so it is a personal story of struggle as well. Still, I think it is a little odd that it did not cover <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_slave_trade">the slavery that occurred among Africans</a> before the colonialists arrived. Also missing is a description of the creation of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberia">Liberia</a> which was founded by the freed slaves from United States. But this book is an excellent source of information about African-Americans who have contributed to the society and for the struggle for civil rights.</p>

		<h3>The Doll&rsquo;s House</h3>
		<p>
			<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1852862920?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=211189&creative=374929&creativeASIN=1852862920">Sandman : The Doll&rsquo;s House</a> is one of the Sandman series. I had actually read a later one, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563891387?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1563891387">The Sandman Vol. 7: Brief Lives</a> earlier. It is an engrossing read, as is typical of Gaiman. I was very amused by the idea of a Conference for Serial Killers (known as the &ldquo;Collectors&rdquo;).

		<h3>Another Day of Life</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0375726292?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0375726292">Another Day of Life</a> is about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angolan_Civil_War">Angolan Civil War</a>. It is deeply personal and free from assumptions and stereotypes about Africans. The author claims to have evidence of  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FNLA">FNLA</a> troops practicing Cannibalism and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITA">UNITA</a> getting the funding from American Churches. It is amazing to read about what the author had to go through to cover this important event in Cold War Era.</p>.

		The main reason for finishing only 4 books was, I was stuck reading <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0374191484?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0374191484">The Savage Detectives: A Novel</a> which is a heavy tome. Sadly, I had to give it up as it was reserved by a lot of people. But I have bought a copy now, so hopefully, I should write about it next month!
