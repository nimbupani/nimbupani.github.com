Now that I have posted a painting on my blog, my Hard Disk has decided it was enough of an eye sore and has promptly crashed. So here I am with all evidences of four years of my existence erased :'( 

Thankfully, I can access the internet from office, giving me even more incentive to leave late from office ;)
