The front page has gone through a mini two-day redesign. The interesting thing about the redesign is that I went through with it after consulting my google clicks overlay map and other statistics that Google Analytics provides. 

Most people almost never clicked on my artworks, so out it goes. Also the contact form served only as a honeypot for all spammers, so it disappears as well. My old anti-spam measure is back in, till I figure out a more effective contact form. 

Meanwhile, kind folks at <a href="http://www.blogdesignblog.com/">Blog Design Blog</a> and <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/">sixrevisions</a> have respectively listed my websites under <a href="http://www.blogdesignblog.com/blog-design/30-comment-designs-for-webdesigners/ ">30 Must See Comment Designs for Web Designers</a> and <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/design-inspiration/bright_colorful_web_designs">35 Beautiful Bright, Colorful Web Designs</a>. A big hug and thanks for both of them! 

I also started a <a href="http://nimbupani.etsy.com">store at Etsy</a>. Right now only my Koi Painting is for sale, but hoping to add more items within the next two months. 

Whew! My GTD training is finally bearing fruit. This is the shortest and intensive redesign I have done ever! 

<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://inspiredology.com/web-design/webs-brilliant-blues/">Inspiredology</a> has also linked to Nimbupani Designs as one of the websites "that I thought expressed and used the colour blue in an attractive interesting way to convey their message and/or feel of their brand" Thanks n Hugs!
