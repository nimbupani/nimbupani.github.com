Fourteen years ago, the only way I knew I stayed somewhere near the "heart of Tollywood" is through the presence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalini">Baby Shalini's</a> house nearby and the large crowds that gather at one of the last vestiges of city living: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nandamuri_Taraka_Rama_Rao">NTR's house</a>. It had completely escaped my mind, till recently, to check and update those two references that remind me of the Tinsel Town. So, after fourteen years, I am ashamed to say one of those bonds that used to bind me to Tinsel Town is No More.

Shalini's house is kept intact by their rather wolf-like dog. It is the NTR's house has bitten the dust. Two cramped apartments have taken over and one of the blocks has been lovingly named after the Super Star Krishna. A very sad end - not unlike the tragedy of the NTR's demise -  to a very majestic building.

The only reason I remember NTR's bunglow is because it used to signal the last sign of humanity for me in that area. Beyond that building was a large sparse road, surrounded by the Most Foul Smelling garbage dump. There werent even street lights at that time. And, in such a desolate landscape, with only smelly pigs for company, NTR's bungalow was a breath of fresh air. 

Fourteen years on, the pigs have vanished and so has the dump. They have all been taken over by apartments of various shapes and sizes. "Desolate" is not the word that will strike you when you see them.

Time Changes Everything.
