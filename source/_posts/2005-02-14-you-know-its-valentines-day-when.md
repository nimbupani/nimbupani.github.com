...KFCs and Long John Silvers are crowded with families. 

Pizzahut and Sakae Sushi have long queues of couples (all kinds) for seats which used to be empty just a day before. 

guys and girls walk hand in hand with the girl invariably carrying a big stuffed toy (tigger, teddybear, bunny) or roses and pointing out other things that the guy ought to buy for her

Happy Valentine's Day (Bleh!)
