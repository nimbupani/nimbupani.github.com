<p>In the last post, I described some <a href="http://nimbupani.com/blog/stalking-africa-online-part-1.html">African blogs to keep track of for stalking information about Africa</a>. Here are some of my favourite places online for listening to African news and music and a list of books I liked.</p>	
<p>The best part of African culture is the music. I stumble upon some amazing bands through these podcasts:</p> 
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.afropop.org/podcast/">Afropop Worldwide</a> has a good mix of West/South African music. But, I think it is too short and has less music and more commentary.</li>
	<li><a href="http://wfmu.org/playlists/RF">Radio Freetown</a> plays choice hits of West Africa. They have not updated for the past 5 months, but the archives are well worth a listen.</li>
	<li>
<a href="http://ethnomusic.podomatic.com/ ">World Passport</a>, is mostly African music spiced with songs from other countries (mostly US). Pity they don&rsquo;t update it anymore. The archives are great! </li>            
</ul>              
<p>These days though, I listen to songs on <a href="http://grooveshark.com">Grooveshark</a>.The songs stream quickly and are of good quality.</p>
<p>The only non-music podcast I listen to is the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/podcasts/series/africa/">BBC&rsquo;s Africa Today</a> has a round up of African news and tries to be unbiased. I  heard about <a href="http://blog.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2009/06/05/charles_taylor_converts_to_judaism">Charles Taylor’s conversion to Judaism</a> first here, before it made front pages elsewhere.</p>                                      

<h3>Books</h3>
<p>I have not read that many books about Africa, but I really liked the these:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385425139?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385425139">The Famished Road</a> — Fascinating mix of legends with the story of a young boy growing up in poverty.</li>

They both present similar facets of Arabic Africa. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802170269?ie=UTF8&tag=nimbupani-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0802170269">The Translator</a> has a slightly different viewpoint — that of a Sudanese muslim woman who works as a translator. </li>

This is a heart wrenching book. I took days to recover from reading this story. </li>
