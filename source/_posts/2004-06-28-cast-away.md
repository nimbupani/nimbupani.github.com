I am still suffering from limited internet access. For the first time in some four years. I have gone without checking my mails for more than three days. Sigh.. but I have just got myself a 3 Mbps connection from <a href="http://www.starhub.com/online/maxonline/index.html">Starhub</a> which comes free with a wireless router and a 15% discount on the monthly fee for unlimited access. But the installation of all that will happen only this thursday. So until then, I am totally cut off :(
