The biggest ever press revolt against George W Bush has just begun to look powerful with the <a href="http://economist.com/printedition/displaystory.cfm?Story_ID=3329802">Economist</a> joining the fray. Previously, the <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/102604F.shtml#1">New Yorker</a> distinguished itself by exhibiting bias by supporting John Kerry for the first time in its existence, along with a not-so-surprising "against Bush" bias shown by <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D16F93F5E0C748DDDA90994DC404482">New York Times</a>. 

Are the American voters listening?
