Just a quick word to say I found a beautiful house and I will be offline for quite sometime (my comp here AND in madras are not working).. which also brings me to my trip to madras. Just when I was hoping to gain some mental peace by surfing the web as quietly as possible in madras, my mom breaks the earth rattling news of the madrasi comp's death. I can't understand what the problem is in the simple words she used to state it. So I gotta get back to investigate and find a solution, which will take too long a time. And I am taking too much of your time too..
