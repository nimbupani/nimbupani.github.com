This was the picture I took when I was just about to land at the <A href="http://www.bangkokairport.org/newversion/index.asp">Bangkok International Airport</a>. I really love the different shades of blue. Oh well, Bangkok Airport, for all its frills, is absolutely expensive. I got a coffee in a teeny weeny cup for two <-insert abusive words->U.S. dollars!
