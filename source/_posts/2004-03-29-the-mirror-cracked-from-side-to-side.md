I was always fascinated by mirrors. Especially the one in the hair cutting saloons. I actually used to try to count the number of my heads visible on the several "mirrors" within the two mirros opposite each other. I remember I used to go with my Dad to cut my hair in his hair cutting saloon when I was THIIIISSS small ( as there were no "beauty parlours" for kids then) - and wonder why all the ladies in the posters were wearing very less clothes :) :). I do remember the strong smell of shaving cream that filled the narrow passage between the barber and the entrance.  

Anyways, the point of this post is to link to <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0,6121,1178825,00.html">this </a>extremely interesting review of a book about mirrors (via  <a href="http://www.nchicha.com/cupofchicha/">Cup of Chicha</a>).  It is an awesome review of mirrors and the human obsession with reflection .  Apparently, human beings are one of the few animals that can recognise reflections.  Now you know where the story about the lion jumping into the well to fight with its own reflection came about!
