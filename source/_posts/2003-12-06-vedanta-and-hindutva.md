The Hindu has produced a very thoughtful <a href="http://www.hindu.com/lr/2003/12/07/stories/2003120700100100.htm">extract</a> on <a href="http://www.vivekananda.org/biography.asp">Swami Vivekananda's</a> revolutionary <a href="http://www.education-india.net/inspirationals/vivekanandwelcome.php">speech</a> at the World Congress of Religions. He considers Hinduism as the mother of all religions as it was the only religion to recognise other religions and also explains the moral codes and ethics that all religions tend to practice in philosophical terms.  

But, the underlying message of the superiority of hinduism and heirarchy of religions has given enough ammunition to the 'Hindutva' "leaders" to pull down several more mosques. 

<b>P.S:</b> The philosophical basis for Hinduism apparently follows what modern science has figured out. More in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570625190/qid=1070767621/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/104-9888278-4721531?v=glance&s=books">The Tao of Physics</a> .
