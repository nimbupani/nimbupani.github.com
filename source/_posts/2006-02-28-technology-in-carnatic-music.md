I am watching BBC now early morning (12.45 a.m.) and I see that <a href="http://www.indiaartist.com:16080/shashank/">Shashank</a> has a powerbook infront of him for his performances.&nbsp; I am touched to see my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">beloved</a> to playing such an important part in another of my loves: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music">carnatic music</a> (though I am very curious to know why he would need it when other performers carry on fine without any gadgets). <br /><br />The program (Destination India | Music) is focussing on a musical event called <a href="http://saptak.org/">Saptak</a>. <br /><br />
