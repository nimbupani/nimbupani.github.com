Okie, <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/process/index.cfm">this article</a>, gives you a clear and concise introduction to building your website with CSS. Well, you do need to know CSS to go through the article. But, its awesome stuff. These guys also brought to us the <a href="http://css.maxdesign.com.au/selectutorial/">select tutorial</a> a good introduction to selectors in CSS. Get all their tutorials <a href="http://www.maxdesign.com.au/presentation/">here</a>. I think its time for an another blog redesign :)
