Made me ponder about how big media conglomerates now become oligopolistic threats. With every U.S. based news reports presenting an overly biased reports on the iraq war (and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com">only</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">two</a> admitting to their lies and distortions), it is really frightening world we are living in. Thankfully, we have <a href="http://english.aljazeera.net/HomePage">other sources</a> on the net. But not everyone is that fortunate -which explains why President Bush is still a contender for the elections.
