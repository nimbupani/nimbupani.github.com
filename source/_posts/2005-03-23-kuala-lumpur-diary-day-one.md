Landed in the wee hours of a saturday morning after getting fleeced by a cab driver for driving us to the hotel at such a time (triple the normal rate of RM 6). We arrived to face the dour and rude faces manning the reception and the security counters at the Z grade <a href="http://www.wirahotel.com.my/">Hotel Wira</a>. Thankfully, the bad service stopped there as I found the rooms to be in good condition and clean.

After a bit of a sleep, we freshened up to climb the 272 steps of <a href="http://www.malaysiasite.nl/batucaveseng.htm">Batu Caves</a> which are just a few minutes off KL. In fact they are the biggest identifiable landmarks around KL. You can see them from most parts of KL (though I admit I havent been to several others).

Batu Caves were beautiful. It is technically like the <a href="http://murugan.org/temples/palani.htm">Palani Malai</a> of T.N. as it is the abode of Murugar, though here, its his "Vel" that is worshipped. We reached Batu Caves by 7.30 a.m. and the guy at the counter below the mountain said the temples open by 8 a.m. and that it will take that much time anyway to climb the hill! 

I was shocked that the temple was opening so late as compared to those in India or Singapore and incensed by his assumption that I would take so long to climb those steps -which is why I think I completed the climb in five minutes =)

Batu Caves apparently are limestone formations. It was heavenly. The view from the caves is gorgeous and the holy shrines just makes you want to worship even if you were an atheist. There are several "caves" but most of them were locked when we went. Only the main shrine was open.

The cave has its fair share of graffiti and it was sad to see graffitti painted with those aerosol cans that are really ugly to look at. 

Surprisingly the caves do not seem to have bats. And even more surprising is the fact that there are two roosters within the caves which get constantly chased by the monkeys. 

Which brings me to the real pests of the place -monkeys. I hope some biologist does a study of the monkeys here to determine how brain evolves. These monkeys can detect even the slightest movement of food and have highly evolved techniques of extracting food from the happless people. I saw one threatening a poor woman into giving him/her a packet! TO those non-believers in evolution, please visit Batu Caves to see how closely we relate to these creatures. We almost share the same qualities!

We next stopped by the KL telecommunications tower which is technically taller than the Petronas as it is situated on a hill. From here you can see the whole of KL and they have rightly or wrongly installed powerful nikon binoculars which can zoom to the entrance of batu caves and lets you actually see the people moving there. Batu caves is 15 km off KL!

So if you go to <a href="http://www.menarakl.com.my/main.cfm">KL tower</a>, the whole of KL comes under your scrutiny. If you think your wife is cheating on you, and you happen to lie in KL do not waste time in detectives, simply spend RM 6 and go to the KL tower and look at every nook and corner as you please!

Next stop was supposed to be Petronas, but I stumbled across the Isetan in the <a href="http://www.suriaklcc.com.my/">Suria KLCC</a> and never looked back. Spent almost two hours shopping at jaw dropping prices! Whew, never felt so tired ever. 

Deepak and I then looked up <a href="http://umaipadam.blogspot.com">Maran</a> who kindly took us to Little India in KL. It was awesome to meet him and he was really funny and humourous! After some two hours we headed off to <a href="http://chetan.ckunte.com/archives/2005/03/20/aaryana-is-now-5">Aaryana's birthday party</a>.

It was an amusing party with kids all over the place. They even had a clown! I was totally mesmerised by her magic tricks and games! The best part was the birthday cake! It was a barbie doll dressed up in loads and loads of cream! Woah! I never knew I was so deprived as a child ;-) Mummy, I want my barbie doll cake =D The foood was DELICIOUS! slurrpp still savouring it =)

We then roamed around <a href="http://thestar.com.my/news/storyx1000.asp?file=/2001/1/30/nation/3011crco&sec=">Bukit Bintang</a> which was, unlike the Orchard road in Singapore, alive and very active at 12 in the night! Amazing night life!! Every shop, small or big, is open! Singapore, you can never compete with KL for the experience, alright? No use pretending to have a night life when there is none.

Finally we all went back to the rat hole and rested.

Whew, that was a LONGGG entry. The next day beckons....
