Only after viewing them in color that I realise, despite their disgusting atrocities and horrendous behaviour, the Nazis knew how to inspire awe in the normal citizens. One look at the parade snaps and all I could feel was awe. The combination of a striking symbol in an awesome combination of black and red really does make it memorable. They had an unassailable brand.
