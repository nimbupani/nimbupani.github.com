Seastars 2007 is a music album by <a href="http://ramblinglibrarian.blogspot.com/">Ivan Chew (ramblinglibrarian)</a> and <a href="http://lekowala.wordpress.com/">Adrian Loo</a>. It is a wonderful first album for the band and is a great collection of tunes inspired by the sea.

My favourite track is the Dolphins Galaxia 1.1 - basically for its variation of tunes used and being so soothing. Sea Anemone and Sea Breeze were the other two songs I couldnâ€™t forget. The rest of the songs seemed like good "background music" to listen to while you are at work. Well, that is just my take anyway. When I listened for the first time, the laughter of the child seemed unique, but the second time it sounded slightly longer than what I thought it should be. 

But, it is a good first album nevertheless! I would definitely listen to all the songs again !
