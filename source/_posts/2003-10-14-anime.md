Aha! my first anime illustration. now to learn the tricks and trades of photoshop. My lack of photoshop knowledge lets me down. Why..why, did I use the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/076453694X/qid=1066145541/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-7906027-7491267">Photoshop Bible</a> as my pillow everytime I borrowed that book? Time to look into all that and make my anime illustrations come to life!

P.S: Look <a href="http://vyom.org/cat_other/on_anime.php">here</a> for an intro to anime. <a href="http://www.polykarbon.com/">This</a> and <a href="http://www.anipike.com/index.php?sid=895872205&cat=611&t=sub_pages">this</a> are some good links to How-Tos on  Anime Illustration. 

<b>Update:</b> Before you start insulting my drawing skills by asking where I copied this picture from, I am pleased to let you know that I drew it myself using the tutorials from the sites mentioned above. And yeah, the image belongs to me.
