<a href="http://deepak.jois.name">Deepak J</a> developed a java command line flickr uploader - which means seamless syntaxibility in Windows, Linux and other OSes running Java. Apparently it can handle batch processing too. Watch out for <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com/2005/09/futureware.html">Deepak's Blog Entry</a> for details.

Meanwhile, I worked at office, ate like a pig, and fought off some flab in a pilates class.

<strong>More Mac Goodness:</strong> A <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/mobile/">normal looking phone with iTunes</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a> are the latest "blessings" from Steve Jobs to us addicts. And I guess they are listening to the market after all. 

Wonder how much more Steve Jobs can squeeze the iPod dry. iPod nano comes in black too! Wonder why there is no pink =(
