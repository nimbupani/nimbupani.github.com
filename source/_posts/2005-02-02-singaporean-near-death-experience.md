title: " Singaporean Near Death Experience"

I read about <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/33748.asp">the incident</a> in <a href="http://www.todayonline.com.sg">Today</a> - A brave boy tries to take on the Father of the Nation.  I didnt realise the gravity of the situation because of the literal reporting style of Today reporters. ("Jamie Han asked... and MM replied"). 

Its an amazing near death experience that Jamie Han could have ever undergone. I would  have thought such events will never get reported but the guilty party be hauled over to the Changi Prison. I thought this was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989">Tiananmen Square</a> of Singapore. But amazingly, it seems the event DID get reported on the main newspapers, MM only got angry but didnt launch scathing attacks on the family tree of Jamie Han and Jamie Han was not accused of slander or forced to declare bankruptcy. 

WOW! Is it possible?
