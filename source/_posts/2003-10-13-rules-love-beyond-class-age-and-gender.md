I finally got down to watching <a href="http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/sep/05rules.htm">Rules</a> after a desparate battle with Neural Networks. Ah!What a refreshing change it turned out to be! The first Hindi movie in a long, long time I have actually enjoyed watching till the end. 

I hope Rules is the harbinger of the change in Indian mindset about gays and lesbians. The film rightly portrays love as a universal force beyond caste, class or gender. It is a "cute" movie that everyone can identify with- the second movie I have come across on teenage crushes (the first was Guddi). 

But I think the alls-well-that-ends-well ending does not augur well for teenagers. Millions of star-struck teenagers may get the wrong ideas after watching the movie (no, I dont think any teenage brat is level-headed enuf! :) ) 

Milind Soman, watch out! you might just have brought it upon yourself! :)
