Tabish Khair, an Indian scholar based in Denmark, hits the nail on its head when he talks about the <a href="http://www.hindu.com/mag/2003/12/21/stories/2003122100410100.htm">colour of the passports</a>.  He puts very eloquently, how the new devices meant to check the travel of terrrorists are in reality just measures to check the poor races from reaching out to the 'developed' world:

<i>So, I hang on to my passport for I do not want to forget both these relationships. My passport reminds me how marginal I am in the global heart of whiteness, and how childish and superfluous are the squabbles of our (Third World) governments. My passport reminds me of what I share with Nepalis, Algerians, Nigerians, yes, even Pakistanis. My passport reminds me that bin Laden and his ilk are little more than excuses. The new rule for transit visas has little to do with terrorism and everything to do with terror of people with the wrong colour of passport. Europe and the U.S. ? and their satellites like Australia ? have long been frightened of those who have little cash and cannot be conveniently ignored. This fear goes back a long way: it did not grow out of the foolhardy act of a handful of young men flying planes into buildings in New York and Washington. That tragic event simply provided the excuse to take legislative and other action that many have wanted to take for decades in the "West".</i>
