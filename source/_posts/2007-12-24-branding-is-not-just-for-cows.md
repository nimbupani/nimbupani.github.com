I stumbled across <a href="http://ittybiz.com/">IttyBiz</a> blog two weeks ago. Naomi Dunford (a "word nerd") writes in a way that is entirely unique - full of humor and completely making sense (it is <em>very hard</em> to do both!). Recently, she wrote <a href="http://ittybiz.com/marketing-school-what-the-hell-is-branding/">Marketing School: What The Hell Is Branding?</a> which sent shivers down my spine (in a good way). 

<blockquote><p>A brand does not convey ability. Itâ€™s not supposed to. A brand is supposed to convey consistency.</p></blockquote>

Struggling for the past two years to state what I do, Naomi does that easily in two sentences (okay okay, three). I have always tried to make my online appearances <em>consistent</em> to what Nimbupani Designs (and me) stand as a brand.

So, what do I stand for as a brand? Nimbupani Designs (<a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/blog/about.html">even the name</a>), is not a run of the mill design shop, but is a off-the-beaten-track business. I passionately support web standards, open source projects (<a href="http://drupal.org">Drupal</a>, <a href="http://tabbie.wikidot.com/">Tabbie</a>). I work with <a href="http://status.deepak.jois.name">Deepak</a> and we convert some of my ideas into software (one of which is coming soon to your browser). 

My illustrations reflect that sense too. So does my sense of fashion (mostly from local designers with their small boutiques in Singapore). Possibly, I am still not articulate enough to completely define my branding, but hopefully, it would become apparent soon. 

As for the identity, I have (with the new website) is now consistent with my business card and my sense of style (note the (over) use of yellow). Thanks to Naomi, I have something else to work on for this new year. My branding. 

Meanwhile, what is your branding? What defines you?
