Thursday was the last day to redeem my $100 Starhub voucher to buy mobile phones, and just as fortunately, <a href="http://chakravyuh.blogspot.com">Deepak</a> lost the ugly sony ericsson he had (gathering showers of blessings in the process for losing a phone that looks fitting only in a garbage bin) and so I, generously went with him to get a phone from my $100 voucher. 

As usual, I couldnt take my eyes off the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/motoinfo/product/details/0,,128,00.html">V3 Pink</a>. And miraculously, I had enough sense to ask for the price with my current plan and the voucher. It was $98. 

Dreams come true. Now.
