<p>I often hunt for official specifications for which CSS property is supported on which version of a browser. The fastest and best source for that is <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/css">Sitepoint CSS Reference</a>. But sometimes I like to verify it with the official documentation. So that I can <span class="strike">have more time to tweet</span> be more productive, here are the links to the official documentation of CSS support for all mainstream browsers.</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/specs/">Opera</a>
	(Look for Opera Presto 2.3 for CSS features included in Opera 10.1)</li>
	<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariCSSRef/Introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30001267">Safari</a> (lists what is available in which version of Safari, per property. Be warned, some of those listed as "supported" are really <a href="http://nimbupani.com/redesign-of-nimbupanicom.html">not</a>).</li>
	<li>
		 <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa905850.aspx">IE</a> (separate list of supported CSS properties per browser version).
	</li>                                                                                                                                     
	<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS_Reference">Firefox</a> (lists what is available in which version of Firefox, per property)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are looking to use an upcoming standard (like CSS3, HTML5) you can also refer to this <a href="http://a.deveria.com/caniuse/">excellent list of cross-browser support for each feature</a> or the <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/compatibility.html">respected Quirksmode Compatibility Tables</a>.</p>
