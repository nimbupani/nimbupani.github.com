Superheroes and Comics go hand in hand. Or so it seems. There is even an  <a href="http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/">online database</a> of comic action heroes around the world. It has a few of them from India too! 

Comic Superheroes make you the most optimistic kid in the world. Everything suddenly seems possible and there is Nothing To Fear. Of course, it helps that they had a few hidden aces up their sleeves to win over the Evil Men. But they inspire only awe from us all (especially the kids) with their style of standing with their capes flowing in the wind and I-am-in-control confidence. 

But I got bored of the 'fight against evil' theme that each story was based on and so, moved on. But Spiderman was an all-time favourite. Just for the sheer novelty of having a SuperHero with no techno weapons except the use of physical agility and an attractive 'packaging' ( never seen a better designed Superhero garment ), its a combination too hard to resist!
