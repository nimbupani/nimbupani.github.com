<a href="http://www.aypwip.org/webnote/">WebNote</a> (via <a href="http://blog.codefront.net/">Redemption In a Blog</a>) is an awesome tool. Please note the familar "orange button" . So, I can open my notes in any XML (and the other flavours) reader!! Its just about time somebody came up with this application. Soon we will have the <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/tiger/dashboard.html">Dashboard</a> integrated into it and emails too (already Firefox has this <a href="http://update.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?id=173&vid=331&category=&page=releases">extension</a> to alert you about the mails in your gmail account). And I am presuming all these will be available online (with the GBs of space that mail services are dumping on us). When that happens, life will be one awesome smooth ride.
