When planning for a getaway, my dad consults the numerous tourism offices that dot the Anna Salai.  He used to bring home these brochures given out by them and I was completely besotted by them. Especially the ones that were bigger and in colour. Back then, Rajasthan, Orissa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu were the only states that gave away classy and eye catching brochures. But surprisingly, there were no grammatical errors, unlike the brochures on my island :). 

So two years ago, while browsing through my collection of brochures, I spotted this guy with a very attractive yellow turban. And I immediately got down to work of painting him :)<br/>
