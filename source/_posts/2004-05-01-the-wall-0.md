I thought this was a haunted house, till some three years ago some events relating to promoting Chinese heritage started happening in this <a href="http://www.chineseheritagecentre.org/">building</a> started appearing. The  Chinese Heritage Centre is one of the oldest buildings you can ever see in NTU. I love the different colors of blue which provide a soothing contrast to the deep rich earth tone of the bricks. 

But anyways, some people believe that some of those closed windows belong to rooms which have never been opened and are presumably haunted :P
