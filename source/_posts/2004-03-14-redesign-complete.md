Ok, the most important parts of this website have already gone under scrutiny. Some new pages have been introduced (Portfolio and Goodies) which will soon be completed. 

This officially launches my hobby as a website designer. Anyone with money and websites to design can <a href="mailto:divya at nimbupani dot com">contact</a> me. I am more than enthusiastic to help you get a good website up. I need to stash away some money to help me cover the "search cost" of finding a job [Economics did me good after all!].

Notes:
<ul><li><a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/archives.php">archives</a> have been made more organized and pleasing to view.</li><li>The sidebar has been customised for each page.</li><li>I have trusted the <a href="http://www.google.com">God of Search Engines</a> than my MT Search for faster results.</li><li>I have become greedy and added my <a href="http://amazon.com/gp/registry/7IW2I1L1ASL3">wishlist.</a></li><li>Made a cute logo for myself.</li></ul>
