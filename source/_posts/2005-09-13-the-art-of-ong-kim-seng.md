An exhibition of Singapore's acclaimed watercolor artist <a href="http://www.ongkimseng.com">Ong Kim Seng</a> is up at the 36th Floor of <a href="http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=106364">Capital Tower</a>.

I love watercolor art as  most of them slant towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism">impressionist style of painting</a> - there is a lot of meaning in what is left unsaid. 

Back to Mr. Ong, Ong Kim Seng's paintings were AMAZING. I know I generally gloat over most artists, but the collection that was on display was awesome. Some of them were normal but many distinguished themselves by both the attention to detail and the delibrate lack of details. I really loved the way he creates focus areas on his paintings through a high contrast and making it  an oasis of serenity in the midst of noise all around in the paintings.

The paintings I best liked are not online anywhere =(, if you guys find them do let me know, they were: Shadow on the Wall, Emerald Hill, and Rando Spain. Loved Emerald Hill, especially the use of color!

I am a true fan after reading his FAQ entry that he didnt learn painting from anyone! 

He has also written a book on "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1929834233/104-9403162-5159137?v=glance">Mastering Light and Shade</a>", which is now on my Must-Buy List! 

Also, Mr. Ong has a <a href="http://www.ongkimseng.com/paintings/india_paint.htm">full gallery dedicated to paintings from India</a> =D
