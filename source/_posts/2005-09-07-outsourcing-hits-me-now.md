A few months ago, I was rejected by DBS when I applied for my credit card. I had applied again (assuming it was my bad handwriting, but received no response from them. And today, I got a call now from one of the call centers for DBS in India (specifically South India):

<em>"I am calling from DBS Bank, blah blah..you can enjoy lower/higher interest rates with your DBS Credit Card funds. And.."
</em>
"I dont have a DBS credit card."

[A Pause]

<em>"But you have applied for that right?" </em>
"Yeah, but I have not received any response yet."

<em>"Oh okay, you will be getting it soon. Thank You. Good Bye."</em>

Weird! 

On the subject of humour, check this <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4204412.stm">BBC article on the reality of advertising</a>! It is hilarious! One sample:

<blockquote>Women only wear spectacles in adverts for opticians.</blockquote>
