Got to know that <a href="http://www.deltatangobravo.com/archives/2005/august/favourite">Delta Tango Bravo</a> has linked my favicon as one of the favourites. YAY! 

Which brings the question whatever happened to the icon? Lost in Transmission I guess. =(

Finally those who wear spectacles can look good when getting out of an air conditioned room and not having to face people with moist glasses giving the odious look of a drunk nerd. Thanks to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/life/science/story/0,12996,1558748,00.html?gusrc=rss">nanotechnology which prevents that fog from appearing.</a>

Also discovered <a href="http://www.cedmagic.com/featured/he-man/he-man.html">He-Man snapshots</a>! I have a love-hate relationship with the <a href="http://www.cedmagic.com/featured/he-man/battle-cat.html">Battle Cat</a>.
