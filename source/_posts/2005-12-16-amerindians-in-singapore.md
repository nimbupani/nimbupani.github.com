I spotted these amazing Amerindians performing at The Amara Hotel. Just look at their costumes! How can it not be attractive! Any girl should fall for such awesome get up :) 

They were playing some spanish hits on a different types of flute and spanish guitar to the music from the keyboard. These guys are from Ecuador (pronounced "Equadhor") and will be performing next in Plaza Singapura from today till Monday. Catch them before they go all the way back to Ameeerica! Probably this is the closest I can get to South America! :)

Dont miss their awesome ornaments from Peru, Ecador, and other South American countries (cheap enough I would say!). Hurry!

P.S. Apparently, I look <i>Brazilian</i>. The amerindians all agreed on their assessment of my "nativity" as a Brazilian. Though they did give me an outside chance of being an <i>Indian</i>! I think I can easily join CIA as a spy given the number of nationalities I can assume :P
