I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1568983646/qid=1072597415/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-8595494-0613669?v=glance&s=books">this</a> in my University's library and immediately fell in love with <a href="http://www.rennart.co.uk/games.html">Abram Games</a> style of illustration. The depth of his thought and imagination just blew me away! 

Sigh! Can I EVER be like him? Well, I thought I can, if I tried to copy his style! 
So here, I try to create a vague wood-cut like figure based on an illustration I found in the book.
