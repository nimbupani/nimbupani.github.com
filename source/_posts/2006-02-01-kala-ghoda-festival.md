There is an <a href="http://kalaghodaassociation.com/">awesome arts festival</a> afoot in Mumbai - Kala Ghoda Festival and <a href="http://caferati.blogspot.com/2006/02/caferati-at-kala-ghoda.html">Caferati is hosting an evening of it</a>. The depressing part is I will leave Mumbai on the same day, just before the event starts :(

Here are the details:

Date: 12th February 2006
Venue: David Sasson Library Garden, Kalaghoda
Time: 5.30 p.m. onwards
