I didnt expect to see a film shooting today which is why I couldnt make a permanent imprint of the spectacle that was unfolding at <a href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/publish/stbportal/en/home/what_to_see/landmarks_and_memorials/lau_pa_sat.html">Lau Pa Sat</a> today. 

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/nimbupani/54037095/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/31/54037095_ed26cb82c3.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="kriSHHHHHH!" /></a>

As you may know, Singapore Tourism Board is 'supporting' (I guess it must be financially and otherwise!) the bollywood film <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432637/">'krrish'</a> which stars the young hunk <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hrithik_Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a> and the crew have been here for more than a month shooting at different locations. 

The film is a sci-fi movie where apparently now the hero (Hrithik Roshan) gets super human powers (with Matrix-like costume!), consequently there are several stunts that were shot in Singapore. Today was the shooting of a flying scene from the Clock Tower of Lau Pa Sat to a nearby building.

<a href="http://ultimatenigma.blogspot.com/">Ayekay</a> messaged one hour before I reached Lau Pa Sat that Hrithik Roshan was up there waiting to 'fly' to the next building, and two hours later, Hrithik was still up there waiting. In a rainy day, with a heavy face mask (yay! the sci-fi hero wears a mask!) standing alone at the clock tower, for hours together,  waiting to be yanked by a crane to crash into some building next door with thousands of spectators watching with their mouth open does not seem like a good deal to me - even for 4 million dollars. Sigh, acting is a profession I will decline even if I am offered (get the hint <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rakesh_Roshan">Rakesh</a>?).

But what struck me was the free rein given to the crew to shoot in Singapore with the actors dangling form ropes (precariously), leaping from tall towers, and antics that generally are not seen anywhere in Singapore! I wonder if such freedom will be given to film producers in Singapore to take a sci-fi movie based on a Singaporean super hero!
