Saurin asked me to watch <a href="http://hoochandhamlet.com/acting-like-a-thief/">Acting Like a Thief</a>. It is quite a short movie but raises critical questions. 

As the site says, it brings to the front the struggles of the actors from the community of "thieves". The police torture, the shame, the embarassment, and trying to find a job, and a career that is so poignantly presented in the 15 minutes. 

These guys are doing something that makes a difference to the society in ways unimaginable. Please support them by <a href="http://www.justgive.org/giving/donate.jsp?charityId=18937&designation=Hooch%20and%20Hamlet">donating</a> to their cause, so that they can create the bigger film and popularise the cause of Chharas.
