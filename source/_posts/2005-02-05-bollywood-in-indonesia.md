The tsunami is not the only link that connects India and Indonesia, trying to search for a hindi song "inspired" by Roxette's "the look" , I landed up on this site that <a href="http://tamanbollywood.singcat.com/radiofm/adoptedhindisongs.shtml">lists Indonesian songs that are copied from bollywood songs</a>. There is also a link to why <a href="http://tamanbollywood.singcat.com/artikel/bollywood_in_indonesia.shtml">bollywood is popular in Indonesia</a>. 

So does anybody know which song it is?
