I finally had an opportunity to create a Web 2.0 design for <a href="http://deepak.jois.name/gcalevent/">Deepak's Google Calendar Event URL Generator</a> (not a <i>creative</i> name I know!).   I also used the icons from the iconset <a href="http://www.icon-king.com/v2/?p=23">Nuvola</a> released for Linux KDE.&nbsp; <br /><br />What Deepak's page does is to generate a "remind me" button (not different from a "subscribe to bloglines" button) that, when clicked, opens in your google calendar as an event you can add. <br /><br />Here is an example of one (my birthday!):<br /><br /><a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&amp;text=Divya%27s%20Birthday&amp;details=My%20birthday%21&amp;dates=20060718/20060718&amp;location=Singapore&amp;trp=false"><img alt="Link Button" src="http://www.google.com/calendar/images/ext/gc_button2.gif" /></a><br /><br />
