Pardon me for cutting short my Mumbai Musings while I pondered on typogaffes and such. The reception conducted to the happiness of the relatives, we found our way to my relative's house. One of those things that happens for the first time in your life.

The New Mumbai is the planners' paradise. If you the organized sort of person, you will love it. It is a very well planned city. But then, the old habit of living in filth hardly goes away, and so the well-planned city looks like a well planned dump. 

Now now, Mumbaiwallas dont get incensed. What I mean to say is, you should get Onyx contract (like Chennai) for your dear city and clean it up to make it as beautiful as it was planned to be. I would rather die than walk on mumbai roads during rainy season (you never know what kind of shit is floating on water!). 

Mumbai newspapers. If there ever was ethics, you wont know its existence in Mumbai. Newspapers scream of something all the time! Every newspaper is a tabloid. Every single one. No, they dont have tabloid dimensions, but they ALL have the same sleazy content. I surveyed <a href="http://www.asianage.com/">Asian Age</a>, <a href="http://timesofindia.com">Times of India</a>, <a href="http://www.hindustantimes.com/">Hindustan Times</a>, and another whose name I forget now.  And they are gonna start two more! Heck! 

I fear the same fate will befall Chennai with the invasion of the Deccan Chronicle. In the best interest of choice, we are led to the path of the hobson's one, when every newspaper thinks the only way to  capture a market is through exclaimation marks. 

Met cousins and <i>talked</i> to them for the first time =D. Enjoyed it! I have seen my nieces and nephew when they were one or two years old and now they are more than ten! I feel old again! Realised evolution is at work as the new generation kids are smarter than the old ones. 

The only travelling I did was on an auto from one relative's place to the other. Went to the subji market and actually spoke hindi for the second time in my life (attempts to speak hindi at the second language classes in school are not counted). And miraculously, the shopkeeper understood! Perhaps I should try more often =D (especially if <a href="http://ultimatenigma.blogspot.com/">AyeKay</a> can speak, why cant I? After all he is tamizh too!).

In the airport, saw <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anu_Malik">Anu Malik</a> with red tight "top" (it would be demeaning to call it a "shirt")and the trademark topi (or whatever that thing is!). Tempted to give the MTV-style "One Tight Slap", but managed to resist the temptation.
