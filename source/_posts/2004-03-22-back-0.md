This site is back... nothing of note has happened in the intervening interval :) except the realisation that you need to throughly check those cheap web hosting service providers before you sign up for their ridiculously cheap schemes. Realised it the hard way. 
The villain in my case is <a href="http://www.kytec.com/">kytec</a>. What I thought will be achieved in one day extended to three days and finally, in desperation, signed up with my existing and extremely sweet -slightly expensive-<a href="http://www.sg.gs">webhosts</a>.
<ul><li>Lesson 1: Always test the customer service response time. Make a trial call to them or mail them and see how fast they get back to you. In my case the mail or the very presumptuous "support ticket" got no response. The "24 hour 365 days" customer support on the phone got answered on the fourth try -with long hold time for the first three attempts.</li>
<li> Lesson 2: Ask people if they  have tried it. Cheaper services come at a price. Make sure you know what the price is.</li></ul>

I am hoping they would atleast fulfill their "30 days money back guarantee".
