Finally we have a <a href="http://www.800ceoread.com/BLOG/">non-techie corporate sponsor</a> of Firefox! Yay! <a href="http://www.800ceoread.com/BLOG/">800CEORead Blog</a> is  organizing a <a href="http://www.800ceoread.com/blog/archives/000560.html">give away</a> of two slots for the NYT ad. So here is me trying my luck for it. :)
Anyways, it doesn't matter as long as you click on <a href="http://firefox.com">firefox</a> and use the browser! I shall die a happier soul, knowing I have made someone see the light ;) (guess I am going overboard on the evangelising stuff :)).
