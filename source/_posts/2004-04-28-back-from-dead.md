After a marathon run of three exams in five days, I am finally back from the cemetry. Whew.. feels good. Especially after a week thinking of which chapter next to study or when to take a break and planning for every hour of the day to pack in as much studying as possible. 

Anyways, this post also is to announce that Iraq now has a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1204666,00.html?=rss">new flag</a> apparently. I kinda like the old one :P

P.S. my exams aren't over yet. But I just have one more to go and its economics! So I NEED to be online to read up on the latest economic trends ;-)
