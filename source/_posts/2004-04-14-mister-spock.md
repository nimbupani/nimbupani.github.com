I have never seen the recent episodes of Star  Trek. Somehow, I never got down to it. But I really adored the first Star Trek that ever came out. In the early days of Indian Cable Television, Star Plus used to telecast this relic of a show just after I used to come back from school. I adored it for the extremely funny looking Mister Spock who tried his best to act as Mr. Jeeves of the serious looking Bertie Wooster-like James T. Kirk - always rescuing him from grave dangers posed as mortal Kirk was not strong enough to "resist" the temptations.

Ah, those were the days. But the point is, the <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0113064/2004/04/13.html#a2458">Cartoonist</a> has linked to a <a href="http://curtdanhauser.com/Characters.html">website</a> dedicated to the series of comics produced during the time the first Star Trek was shot. A good nostalgic trip.
