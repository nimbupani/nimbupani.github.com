I am not sure if any one of you noticed the new addition to the google toolbar- The "Blog This" button. If you have a blog with <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a> then you can use the red button to directly post to your blogger blog about the link currently open in your Internet Explorer browser.
