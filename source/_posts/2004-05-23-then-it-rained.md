It's raining! YES!!! its raining in madras. Gods be blessed! Just as I was about to bang my head in frustration, I could smell the scent of the first few drops falling on the parched and over baked earth. Ah! beauty at last! feels so goood. And I would like to think of myself as the herald of rains ;) . Ooops, now that it has rained, I expect the Electrictiy Board will shut down the current for an hour to mark the solemn moment. And I better finish this off before that.
