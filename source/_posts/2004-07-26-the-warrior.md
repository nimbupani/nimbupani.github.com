Everything I wanted to say about the movie, had been said in an unsaved post which was destroyed by the Evil Computer that I am saddled with. But anyways, color fanatics and arty snobs please rush to watch this movie before it dies a silent death. Its way too good. I cant compare it with anything, but it should have won an oscar for its cinematography, specifically only for the blue skies and the creamy barren desert beneath it. I am not wasting any more time on this post, lest my computer gets wise and shuts off.
