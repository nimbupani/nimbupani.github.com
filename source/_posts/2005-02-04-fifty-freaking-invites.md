After my consistent negligence of the gmail invites (I used only two of some twenty that was offered), gmail has had enough of my negligence and wishes me to do my "duty" of distributing the gmail invites. I tried to hoodwink the system by sending the invites to random email addresses that dont exist, but the system is too clever for that and didnt recognise such emails as invites =( 

So here is my request, if you have been living in a cave for the last six months do not fret, I am here as a generous distributor of gmail accounts! I have FIFTY invites to be given (yes yes 50) . Be good and leave your email id in the comments if you want one.
