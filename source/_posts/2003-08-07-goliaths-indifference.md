We all know how callous the MNCs have always been, given their ability to wrangle away from any situation by greasing a few palms of the Government. Right from <a href="http://www.bhopal.com">Union Carbide</a> to <a href="http://www.tni.org/energy/pe/enron.htm">Enron</a>, the MNCs have cared two hoots about Indians or their safety. Now here are the other giants who have bitten the dust. The Centre for Science and Environment has found out that <a href="http://www.myenjoyzone.com/">Coca-Cola's</a> and <a href="http://www.pepsi.com">Pepsi's</a> soft drinks <a href="http://www.upi.com/view.cfm?StoryID=20030807-042913-1661r">contain pesticide residues far in excess of the European Union Norms</a>. 

The citizens were rightly concerned in the 70s which led to a demand for the MNCs to turn partly desis This made Coca-Cola withdraw from the Indian Market. ( it did not make an appearance till the 1990s when these restrictions were lifted). It is necessary that the MNCs realise that in any country, the safety and security of its citizens comes first. The behaviour of Pepsi and Coke smacks of imperialism, which was last seen in the East India Company (the company that 'conquered' India). Its about time the MNCs realise that when in Rome they have to be Romans.
