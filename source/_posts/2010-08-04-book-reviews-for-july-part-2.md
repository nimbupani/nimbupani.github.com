<p>I have racked up too many books unreviewed, which means (un)fortunately means shorter reviews. Here goes:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		<h3>Landing Page Optimization: The Definitive Guide to Testing and Tuning for Conversions</h3>  
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470174625?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0470174625">Landing Page Optimization</a> covers a lot on statistical models necessary to analyze a &ldquo;landing page&rdquo; to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; more people. I found the repeated need for &ldquo;conversions&rdquo; unnerving. The author found the need to write on how everyone (except the marketing expert) can block the process of optimizing the landing page and tactics to get around that. Sad.

		<h3>Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?</h3>
		<p>As far as I know, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401223478?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1401223478">This</a> is the only set of Superman stories written by Alan Moore. Stylistically, the stories are drawn to resemble Jack Kirby&#x27;s work (it is lovely!) It is a great read if you like Superman.</p>
	</li>               
	<li>
		<h3>Murder Mysteries</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/156971634X?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=156971634X">Murder Mysteries</a> is an adaptation of a Neil Gaiman story and brings same joy as Sandman series with an extra benefit of also being a whodunnit.</p>
	</li> 
	<li>
		<h3>A Mosque in Munich: Nazis, the CIA, and the Rise of the Muslim Brotherhood in the West</h3>
		<p>In the early 30s, the Nazis established an organization to get Muslim refugees from USSR together to foment uprisings in Muslim provinces of USSR (now independent nations). After WWII, US joined in this scramble, literally stealing prized Muslim leaders from Germans (meanwhile the Nazi head of said organization goes unpunished, and retained his privileged status, in the new German government). Similar techniques were in play to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA_activities_in_Afghanistan#Afghanistan_1985" title="CIA activities in Afghanistan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">drive out the Soviets from Afghanistan</a>. If there is one book that will strip away the romance of diplomacy and notions of noble intentions of any country, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0151014183?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0151014183">this</a> would be it. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
		<h3>The Vampire Files</h3> 
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0441014275?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0441014275">The Vampire Files, Volume Two</a> was a random pick from the <a href="http://spl.org">Library&rsquo;s</a> recommended books section. This is a pulp whodunit featuring a vampire as a detective. I thought it would be as wonderful as <a href="http://nimbupani.com/book-reviews-for-june-2009.html" title="Book Reviews for June 2009 | Nimbupani Designs">The Automatic Detective</a>, alas, it is not.</p>
	</li>

		<h3>Fantasies of a Bollywood Love Thief: Inside the World of Indian Moviemaking</h3> 
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0156030845?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0156030845">Fantasies of a Bollywood Love Thief</a> is an absurdly tacky title for a book on the making of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omkara_(film)" title="Omkara (film) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Omkara</a> by Stephen Alter (cousin of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Alter">Tom Alter</a>). The narrator takes a backseat and lets the conversations speak for themselves. The book does not take any stereotyped view of Bollywood and is a glimpse into the power-play and process involved in making movies. Do read if you like seeing Bollywood movies.</p>
	</li>                                                           
	<li>
		<h3>Tea Time for the Traditionally Built</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001NLL8QU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nimbupani-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001NLL8QU">Tea Time for the Traditionally Built</a> is the new book in my favourite series ever: No 1 Ladies Detective Agency. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_No._1_Ladies'_Detective_Agency_(TV_series)" title="The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (TV series) - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">The TV show based on this series</a>, does full justice to the book (though a touch too arty). I will never get tired of this series. Long live Mma Ramotswe!</p>
