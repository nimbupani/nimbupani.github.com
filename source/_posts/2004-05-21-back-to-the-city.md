Whew.. finally I am back home and surfing the web on this super fast broadband internet cafe right next to my house with a sucky windows OS and Internet Explorer. Ah! How I miss my computer! :(  And amazingly this cafe does not have air-con, so I am sweltering in this heat with a woman next to me with repellent jasmine flowers( I am allergic to the scent of jasmine flowers). Of course I see more couples more open than before (atleast in internet cafes :)).

And I came to the city, filling my eyes with the dream of endless days lazily surfing the web and trying to improve my blog :(:(. (warning: drastic change of topic) Anybody up for a bloggers' meet?
