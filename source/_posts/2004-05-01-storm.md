This was taken near the edge of the NTU Universe overlooking the dirty sea ports and foul smelling-smoke spewing factories. 

This picture concludes my series of pictures in and around <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg">my university</a>. Don't think there is anything worth shooting otherwise, except perhaps the <a href="http://www.hall14.com/info.htm">hall of residence</a> bathed in horrible yellow - the very idea of shooting it is depressing.  But the passage of years have somehow dimmed the intensity of the color and hopefully a few more years later, it would have turned a lot more tamer.
