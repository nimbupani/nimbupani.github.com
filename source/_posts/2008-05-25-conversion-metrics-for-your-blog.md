My interest was piqued because it equally applies to bloggers who want to measure the success of their blog. Just realised my blog is way behind any of these metrics and it is time I created my own metrics and set up Google Analytics to measure them. Some of the <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/2007/07/i-got-no-ecommerce-how-do-i-measure-success.html">advanced features of Google Analytics</a> are discussed here which help in measuring some of the metrics above.</p>
