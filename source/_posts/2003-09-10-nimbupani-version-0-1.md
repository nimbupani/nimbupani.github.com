The Observant Owls should have noticed the change in the logo and the activation of the <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/project.html">'Projects' link</a>. This entry is for the others who didn't. Right now, the Projects page is getting updated. I have listed only one ongoing project -the one I am most desperate for help :) . 

I have been hit by the midnight blues. The nightly urge to do something about the sloppy website I own. Sometime soon you might see this site with funny CSS designs (changing every night), but do not despair, I think I wil recover my senses the next morning and I should be able to restore the site to its good old form.

But so far the urge has only been to fill in the blanks. So, you can rest your fears for at least a week. I am not sure when Miss. Hyde will show her true form. But it will be soon :)
