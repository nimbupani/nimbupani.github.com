I made the mistake (in my flu induced delirium) of watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0807758/">Partner</a> an idiotic rip-off of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386588/">Hitch</a>. I would strongly recommend against watching this movie (which will take you one step closer to heaven or Oprah - whoever you believe in). The most interesting “subtle” prejudice that was seen was that the single mother in the movie was Christian (while every other character in the movie is Hindu). I think the majority thinking being Hindus cant be single mothers (which I know a lot of Hindus actually <em>believe</em>).  Of course, just like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0795434/">Namastey London</a> there is a token white man who bears the brunt of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0006795/">Salman Khan’s</a> lecture on the guilt of the White Colonists.
