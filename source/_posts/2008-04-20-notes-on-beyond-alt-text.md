<p>The Nielsen Norman Group has made one of their reports <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/accessibility/">Beyond ALT Text: Making the Web Easy to Use for Users With Disabilities</a> free for download. It is a great reasoned report on how and what the obstacles the handicapped encounter while using the web. I recommend you to download and read the report fully.</p> 
<p> I took some notes and here are a few extracts I found really useful as a web designer.</p>
<p>The blind use the web for:
</p><ol>
	<li>Emailing</li>
	<li>Researching stock trading</li>
	<li>Find recipes</li>
	<li>HAM radio signals</li>
	<li>Phone book</li>
	<li>Directions to own house</li>
	<li>Listen to radio</li>
	<li>Search for jobs</li>
	<li>Download music</li>
	<li>Participate in fan site discussions</li>
	<li>Download books on tape</li>
</ol>
<p>Also interesting to note is, more sighted users use "help" than non-sighted users</p>

<p>There are 75 best practices for designing for the handicapped users. But I found the following tips most useful for designing accessible websites:
</p><ol>
<li>Follow basic rules of good design.</li>
<li>Minimize the use of graphics.</li>
<li>Use ALT text to briefly describe images, and the LONGDESC attribute to thoroughly describe them. </li>
<li>Never blur pictures to indicate unavailability. Remove the picture from view (e.g. button graphics).</li>
<li>Make it easy for users to skip any multimedia and Flash demos.</li>
<li>Do not automatically create a text-only version of your site.</li>
<li>Avoid using pop-up windows. If you do use pop-up dialog boxes, make sure the default action is the most forgiving. </li>
<li>Avoid opening new browser windows. If you do open new browser windows, always provide a simple way to get back to the siteâ€™s main homepage. </li>
<li>Avoid using cascading menus.</li>
<li>Limit the number of links on a page (not more than 20).</li>
<li>Avoid very small buttons and tiny text for links. </li>
<li>Minimize the need for scrolling. </li>
<li>Limit the amount of information that forms require; collect only the minimum needed. </li>
<li>Make sure tab order is logical. Match the tab order to the visual layout when possible. </li>
<li>In forms, put any instructions pertaining to a particular field before the field, not after it. </li>
<li>Test your sites text fonts and colors with screen magnifiers.</li>
<li>Avoid using tables for aesthetic page design. </li>
<li>Especially in tables, do not use graphics to indicate a state, such as yes/no or on/off.</li>
<li>Summarize all tables (using SUMMARY attribute). </li>
</ol>
