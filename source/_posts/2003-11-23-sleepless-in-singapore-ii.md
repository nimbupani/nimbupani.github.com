I took this snap fearing some fierce hazy lines, but thankfully there were none.  <a href="http://esplanade.com.sg">Esplanade</a> is the Singapore's art and culture hub. The curiously glittering blue diamonds are parts of the roof of the Esplanade (The building itself is out of view).  It looks like a spacecraft hiding behind the Anderson Bridge. But I guess the only reason it looks so is because the <a href="http://www.dparchitects.com/new/gallery.html">architects</a> drew inspiration from the  <a href="http://www.durianpalace.com/whatis.htm">Durian</a> (the staple fruit of Singapore). 

<b>P.S.</b> Read <a href="http://www.riversingapore.com/riverstory1.html">here</a> if you want to know more about the Singapore River.
