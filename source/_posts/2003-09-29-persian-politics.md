<a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com">Bowling for Columbine</a> was a refreshing change from the paranoia of studies. I was amazed that an American would actually be critical about American policies. I had almost given up on them as citizens of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0451524934/002-7906027-7491267?v=glance">Oceania</a>. But they aren't that bad yet I guess. 

The best part of the film was <a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/library/wonderful/index.php">the Wonderful World</a>, which lists America's consistent hypocritical position as a leader of the oppressed and the leader of "Human Rights".<a href="http://www.bowlingforcolumbine.com/library/wonderful/iran.php">This item in the list</a> is about the Iranian conspiracy by CIA that led to the assasination of the democratically elected <a href="http://www.irannationalfront.org/Mossadegh/">Mossadegh</a> and the restoration of the Shah's oppressive regime. All this for precious Arab oil. 

<a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/16554">This</a> review, of a recently published  book unearthing CIA's role in the conspiracy, is quite comprehensive and  gives a good idea of how the image of America as 'anti-colonialist' was shattered with the assasination of Mossadegh. Its <a href="http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1989530">relevance</a> should not be lost on us.
