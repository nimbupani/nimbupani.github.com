I was at the <a href="http://nexus2007.com">Nexus 2007</a> event on Saturday and wrote a detailed report at <a href="http://websg.org/archives/2007/03/nexus_2007.php">Web Standards Group, Singapore</a>. Head over there to see my take! 

Went for a weird NUS Indian Dance performance - weird because it was a good concept and a bad execution that led me to wonder - what the concept was? or for the matter, what <i>IS</i> dance!
