Ever seen that board anywhere? Correct! In front of a hindu temple of course! There is no way we hindus can justify this atrocious hypocrisy.  I had <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2003/12/07/vedanta_and_hindutva.php">pointed out earlier</a> about how Hindu philosophy, by its very nature of tolerance, can claim to be universal. But the sacred books will be of no help if our attitude remains primitive.

I have never seen such signs outside a mosque. Nor have I seen such signs outside churches. But, yeah I did see such a sign ( Non-Parsis are not allowed ) outside the Fire Temple in Bombay. But Parsis have never been as violent as Hindus in proclaiming their religious superiority.

The more I read about <a href="http://www.vhp.org/">VHP's</a> antics and the growing influence of such extremists in the Indian political scene, the more I get frightened about the future of 'secularism' in India. 

I have had teachers who believed that Muslims should 'go back to where they belong'. There was even a school where compulsory registration as a life member of VHP was mandatory for admission. I then realised how deep-rooted this malaise is. India's path towards 'Unity in Diversity' has been filled with thorns but now it seems to have come to a dead end.

Of course, I am not denying other religions are not to be blamed. They are equally responsible. But being in majority, a little bit of 'Practice What You Preach' would do good to Hindus.
