George Monbiot directs the spotlight on the microscopic issues that matter. Especially the fundamentalist religious revivals we have been witnessing -in hinduism, christianity and islam. Undoubtedly, the most worrying are the last two.

I wonder why radical christianity does not have the opposition that radical islam has (of course I have already mentioned it before <a href="http://www.nimbupani.com/2003/12/03/jesus_plus_nothing.php">once</a>). We have several columnists brooding over the violent characteristic of the islamic movements and hazarding a vague solution to make a good copy. But I wonder why the same questions never occur to them about the radical turn of christianity. 

Thankfully, the world has a George Monbiot. He seeks to find the reasons for the illogical behaviour exhibited in U.S. Government policies after George Bush came to power.<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Columnists/Column/0,5673,1195727,00.html"> And finds the answers in the beliefs of the radical christians.</a>
