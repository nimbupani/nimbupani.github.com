I had mentioned <a href=http://www.nimbupani.com/2003/12/12/the_original_precog.php">previously</a> about my fascination with Philip K Dick's sci-fi novels. I am reading his collection of short stories titled "Paycheck" (yup the movie was also "based" on this story). Two things I have realised:
<ul><li>Paycheck the story is more realistic than paycheck the movie. He doesnt save the world atleast (thank God!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0066214122/102-0219939-2586516?v=glance">Prey </a> is most probably "inspired from" his short story called "Colony" where some alien elements take the shape of any substance and dissolve the human beings by wrapping themselves around them. Human Beings are their food. Very uncannily similar Prey. Except Michael Crichton was knowledgable enough to connect this to Neural Networks.</li>
<li>Women play zero or negligible role in all the stories. Almost all stories had no romance. </li>
<li>Many of the stuff he writes arent about inventions but more philosophical. What will happen if man becomes so. One of the stories ("The Defenders") even has a matrix like feel to it. </li>
<li>These stories are much easier to comprehend than <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679740678/qid=1106974843/sr=2-1/ref=pd_ka_b_2_1/102-0219939-2586516">The Man in the High Castle</a>. </ul>
