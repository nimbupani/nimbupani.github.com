Came across<a href="http://www.alhirschfeld.com/"> this artist</a> who did awesome caricatures. Interestingly, he hides his daughter's name("nina")  in each one of them! And next to his signature in the caricature is a roman numeral representing the number of "nina"s that can be found!  Now that's an interesting art! (Apparently, he sometimes omits the numeral  leading to great confusion about the number of "nina"s :)).

Guess the number of "nina"s in <a href="http://www.alhirschfeld.com/images/_content/madave/hirschfeldonstreet2.jpg">this one</a> ( his self-portrait).

He is one genius who has made the best use of simple lines and curves. In each of the caricature you can feel the personality of the person being caricatured. 

In Singapore, you can get your caricature for some S$10 I think. Though those caricatures  arent that bad, none of them are that riveting or compelling as the ones by Al Hirschfield.
