I saw the beautiful crescent of the moon over the tree tops today, looked totally awesome. Sigh, if only I had my camera with me (not that it could actually have captured the beauty). 

This picture was taken quite a long time ago on the way to the south indian adda of our university (the canteen where masala dosas and idlies are served with flourish). I love the texure of trees, marble-like but coarse  :)
